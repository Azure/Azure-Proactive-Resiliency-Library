Welcome to the home of the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library (APRL).

<img src="/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library/media/img/aprl-white.png" width=10%>
<br><br>

This library is built with the intention of being a staging area for guidance and recommendations that can be used by customers, partners and the field in Well-Architected Framework reliability engagements/assessments; with the intent of the guidance and recommendations being promoted, once tested and validated with customers and partners, into the official [Well-Architected Framework documentation](https://aka.ms/waf).

The library also contains supporting [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) queries, and sometimes [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/what-is-azure-powershell) or [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli) scripts, that can help customers, partners and the field identify resources that may or may not be compliant with the guidance and recommendations. The intent for these queries, in the long-term, is to make them part of the [Azure Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) service.

## Get Started

To get started head over to the [Azure Services section]({{< ref "services/_index.md">}}) and then navigate via the appropriate category to find guidance, recommendations alongside supporting Azure Resource Graph queries, Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI scripts to help you discover compliant/non-compliant resources in your environment.
