## Recommendations Details

### PEP-1 - Resolve issues with Private Endpoints in non Succeeded connection state

**Category: Networking**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

A private endpoint has two custom properties, static IP address and the network interface name. These properties must be set when the private endpoint is created. I the state is not in Succeeded state, there might be a problem with the private endpoint or with the associated resource.
