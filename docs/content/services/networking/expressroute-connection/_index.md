## Recommendations Details

### ERCON-1 - For Connections using ExpressRoute Direct circuits and UltraPerformance or ErGw3AZ ExpressRoute Gateways, enable FastPath to improve data path performance between your on-premises network and your virtual network

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Recommendation/Guidance**

ExpressRoute virtual network gateway is designed to exchange network routes and route network traffic. FastPath is designed to improve the data path performance between your on-premises network and your virtual network. When enabled, FastPath sends network traffic directly to virtual machines in the virtual network, bypassing the gateway. Bypassing the gateway enhances resiliency by reducing its utilization of the gateway.
