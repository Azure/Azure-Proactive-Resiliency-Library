## Recommendations Details

### ERC-1 - Implement two or more ExpressRoute circuits for each ExpressRoute Gateway connecting through diverse peering locations

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Connect each ExpressRoute Gateway to a minimum of two circuits, with each circuit connecting from a diverse peering location compared to the other.

### ERC-2 - Ensure the two physical links of your ExpressRoute circuit are connected to two distinct edge devices in your network

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Microsoft (in the ExpressRoute direct model) or the ExpressRoute provider (in the ExpressRoute provider-based model) always offer a physically redundant service. Make sure that the same level of physical redundancy (two physical devices, two physical links) is used across the entire path from the ExpressRoute peering location to your network.

<br><br>

### ERC-3 - Ensure both connections of an ExpressRoute circuit are configured in active-active mode

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

To improve high availability, it's recommended that you operate both the connections of an ExpressRoute circuit in active-active mode. If you configure the connections to operate in active-active mode, the Microsoft network will load balance the traffic across the connections on a per-flow basis.

<br><br>

### ERC-4 - Ensure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection is enabled and configured on customer or provider edge routing devices

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

When you enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) over ExpressRoute, you can speed up the link failure detection between Microsoft Enterprise edge (MSEE) devices and the routers that your ExpressRoute circuit gets configured (CE/PE). You can configure ExpressRoute over your edge routing devices or your Partner Edge routing devices (if you went with managed Layer 3 connection service).

<br><br>

### ERC-5 - Configure monitoring and alerting for ExpressRoute circuits

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Configure monitoring using Network Insights for ExpressRoute circuit availability, circuit QoS, and throughput. Configure alerts for availability metrics and circuit QoS metrics according to [ExpressRoute Circuits | Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/services/Network/expressRouteCircuits/), and throughput metrics when bits/sec exceed a threshold appropriate for the ExpressRoute circuit SKU and customer usage.

Configure alerts using Connection Monitor for ExpressRoute with a Log Analytics workspace, and Network Watcher. Configure alerts for when ChecksFailedPercent exceeds 5%, and when RoundTripTimeMs exceeds a pre-tested average appropriate to the environment.

For ExpressRoute Direct, configure Traffic Collection for ExpressRoute Direct to send flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace.

<br><br>

### ERC-6 - Configure service health to receive ExpressRoute circuit maintenance notification

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

ExpressRoute uses service health to notify about planned and unplanned maintenance. Configuring service health will notify you about changes made to your ExpressRoute circuits.

<br><br>

### ERC-7 - Use a site-to-site VPN as an interim backup solution for a single ExpressRoute circuit

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

If you have not yet added a second ExpressRoute circuit for an ExpressRoute Gateway, use a site-to-site VPN as an interim solution until the second ExpressRoute circuit is available.
