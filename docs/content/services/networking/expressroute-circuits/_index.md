## Recommendations Details

## Recommendations Details

### EXRCT-1 - Ensure both connections of an ExpressRoute circuit are configured and active

#### Importance: Critical

#### Recommendation/Guidance

To improve high availability, it's recommended to operate both the connections of an ExpressRoute circuit in active-active mode. If you let the connections operate in active-active mode, Microsoft network will load balance the traffic across the connections on per-flow basis.

<br><br>

### EXRCT-2 - Physical layer diversity

#### Importance: High

#### Recommendation/Guidance

For better resiliency, plan to have multiple paths between the on-premises edge and the peering locations (provider/Microsoft edge locations). This configuration can be achieved by going through different service provider or through a different location from the on-premises network.

<br><br>

### EXRCT-3 - Diversify primary and secondary connections to customer end routers

#### Importance: High

#### Recommendation/Guidance

Never terminate primary and secondary connections on the same customer end router. This creates a single point of failure.

<br><br>

### EXRCT-4 - Diversify primary and secondary connections to customer end ports

#### Importance: High

#### Recommendation/Guidance

Donâ€™t configure both Primary and secondary connections via same port. This creates a single point of failure.

### EXRCT-5 - Monitor ExpressRoute using Azure Monitor

#### Importance: High

#### Recommendation/Guidance

ExpressRoute monitor provides end-to-end monitoring capabilities including: Loss, latency, and performance from on-premises to Azure and Azure to on-premises

### EXRCT-6 - Configure service health to receive ExpressRoute circuit maintenance notification

#### Importance: High

#### Recommendation/Guidance

ExpressRoute uses service health to notify about planned and unplanned maintenance. Configuring service health will notify you about changes made to your ExpressRoute circuits.

<br><br>

### EXRCT-7 - Ensure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection is enabled and configured

#### Importance: High

#### Recommendation/Guidance

When you enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) over ExpressRoute, you can speed up the link failure detection between Microsoft Enterprise edge (MSEE) devices and the routers that your ExpressRoute circuit gets configured (CE/PE). You can configure ExpressRoute over your edge routing devices or your Partner Edge routing devices (if you went with managed Layer 3 connection service).

### EXRCT-8 - Implement multiple ExpressRoute circuits

#### Importance: Medium

#### Recommendation/Guidance

Implement multiple ExpressRoute circuits in your Virtual Network for cross premises resiliency

### EXRCT-9 - Configure site-to-site VPN as a backup to ExpressRoute private peering

#### Importance: Medium

#### Recommendation/Guidance

Consider using site-to-site VPN as a failover when an ExpressRoute circuit becomes unavailable.
