## Recommendations Details

### ERGW-1 - Connect the ExpressRoute Gateway to two or more circuits from different peering locations for higher resiliency

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Connect each ExpressRoute Gateway to a minimum of two circuits, with each circuit connecting from a diverse peering location compared to the other.

### ERGW-2 - Use Zone-redundant gateway SKUs

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Azure ExpressRoute gateway provides different SLAs when it’s deployed in a single availability zone and when it’s deployed in two or more availability zones. For information about all Azure SLAs, see [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1&year=2023). To automatically deploy your virtual network gateways across availability zones, you can use zone-redundant virtual network gateways. With zone-redundant gateways, you can benefit from zone-resiliency to access your mission-critical, scalable services on Azure

### ERGW-3 - Configure an Azure Resource lock for ExpressRoute Gateway to prevent accidental deletion

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Configure an Azure Resource lock for ExpressRoute Gateway to prevent accidental deletion. As an administrator, you can lock an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource to protect them from accidental user deletions and modifications. The lock overrides any user permission.

### ERGW-4 - Monitor gateway health

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Setup monitoring using Network Insights for ExpressRoute Gateway availability, performance, and scalability.

Configure alerts for availability metrics for routes advertised, routes learned and number of VMs based on the supported amounts for the ExpressRoute Gateway SKU in use. Configure alerts for frequency of routes changed based on the customer environment.

Configure alerts for performance metrics for bits in, bits out and CPU utilization according to [ExpressRoute Gateways | Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/services/Network/expressRouteGateways/). Configure alerts for packets per second based on the supported amount for the ExpressRoute Gateway SKU in use and based on the customer environment.

Configure alerts for scalability metrics for active flows based on the supported amounts for the ExpressRoute Gateway SKU in use and the expected number of flows for the customer environment, and for max flows per second for when this value exceeds a historical baseline for the customer environment.

### ERGW-5 - Configure diagnostic logs and alerts for ExpressRoute virtual network gateway

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Enabling diagnostic logs allows you to capture and view diagnostic information so that you can troubleshoot any failures for ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.

Configure logging for GatewayDiagnosticLog and RouteDiagnosticLog. Create alerts based on the GatewayDiagnosticLog for gateway configuration events, primary changes, and maintenance events. Create alerts based on the RouteDiagnosticLog for changes to static routes and BGP events.

### ERGW-6 - Avoid using ExpressRoute circuits for VNet to VNet communication

**Category: Networking**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

By default, connectivity between virtual networks is enabled when you link multiple virtual networks, each with an ExpressRoute Gateway, to the same ExpressRoute circuit. However, Microsoft advises against using your ExpressRoute circuit for communication between virtual networks and instead use other techniques such as VNet peering, routing in a VNet hub via Azure Firewall, NVA and/or Azure Route Server, site-to-site VPN within Azure, the use of virtual WAN, or the use of SD-WAN.

For more information about why VNet-to-VNet connectivity isn’t recommended over ExpressRoute, see: [Connectivity between virtual networks over ExpressRoute | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/virtual-network-connectivity-guidance)

### ERGW-7 - Configure customer-controlled gateway maintenance - In Preview

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

ExpressRoute virtual network gateways undergo regular updates to enhance functionality, reliability, performance, and security. Configuring and scheduling customer-controlled maintenance will minimize the impact of these updates and align the update schedule to best fit your maintenance windows.
