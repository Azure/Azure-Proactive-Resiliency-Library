## Recommendations Details

### VM-2 - Deploy VMs across Availability Zones

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Azure Availability Zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures. Use availability zones to protect your applications and data against unlikely datacenter failures.

**Resources**

- [Create virtual machines in an availability zone using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/create-portal-availability-zone?tabs=standard)

{{< /collapse >}}

<br><br>

### VM-4 - Replicate VMs using Azure Site Recovery

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

When you replicate Azure VMs using Site Recovery, all the VM disks are continuously replicated to the target region asynchronously. The recovery points are created every few minutes. This gives you a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in the order of minutes. You can conduct disaster recovery drills as many times as you want, without affecting the production application or the ongoing replication.

<br><br>

### VM-5 - Use Managed Disks for VM disks

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Managed disks provide better reliability for VMs in an availability set, because the disks are sufficiently isolated from each other to avoid single points of failure. Also, managed disks aren't subject to the IOPS limits of VHDs created in a storage account.

**Resources**

### VM-7 - Backup VMs with Azure Backup service

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Enable backups for your virtual machines to secure and quickly recover your data. The Azure Backup service provides simple, secure, and cost-effective solutions to back up your data and recover it from the Microsoft Azure cloud.

<br><br>

### VM-8 - Production VMs should be using SSD disks

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Premium SSD disks offer high-performance, low-latency disk support for I/O-intensive applications and production workloads. Standard SSD Disks are a cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels.

It is recommended that you:

- Use Standard HDD disks for Dev/Test scenarios and less critical workloads at lowest cost.
- Use Premium SSD disks instead of Standard HDD disks with your premium-capable VMs. For any Single Instance VM using premium storage for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, Azure guarantees VM connectivity of at least 99.9%.

If you want to upgrade from Standard HDD to Premium SSD disks, consider the following issues:

- Upgrading requires a VM reboot and this process takes 3-5 minutes to complete.
- If VMs are mission-critical production VMs, evaluate the improved availability against the cost of premium disks.

<br><br>


### VM-10 - Enable Accelerated Networking (AccelNet)

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the data path, which reduces latency, jitter, and CPU utilization for the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types.

This configuration is not always required, evaluate this option according to the workload requirements.

{{< /collapse >}}

<br><br>

### VM-11 - When AccelNet is enabled, you must manually update the GuestOS NIC driver

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

When Accelerated Networking is enabled the default Azure Virtual Network interface in the GuestOS is replaced for a Mellanox and consecutively its driver is provided from a 3rd party vendor. Marketplace images maintained by Microsoft are offered with the latest version of Mellanox drivers, however, once the Virtual Machine is deployed, the customer is responsible for maintaining the driver up to date.

<br><br>

### VM-12 - VMs should not have a Public IP directly associated

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

If a Virtual Machine requires outbound internet connectivity we recommend the use of NAT Gateway or Azure Firewall, this will help to increase security and resiliency of the service as both services have much higher availability and SNAT ports. For inbound internet connectivity we recommend using a load balancing solution such as Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway.

{{< /collapse >}}

<br><br>

### VM-13 - VM network interfaces have a Network Security Group (NSG) associated

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Unless you have a specific reason to, we recommend that you associate a network security group to a subnet, or a network interface, but not both. Since rules in a network security group associated to a subnet can conflict with rules in a network security group associated to a network interface, you can have unexpected communication problems that require troubleshooting.

{{< /collapse >}}

<br><br>

### VM-14 - IP Forwarding should only be enabled for Network Virtual Appliances

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

IP forwarding enables the virtual machine network interface to:

Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface.

Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations.

The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it. While IP forwarding is an Azure setting, the virtual machine must also run an application able to forward the traffic, such as firewall, WAN optimization, and load balancing applications.

### VM-18 - Ensure that your VMs are compliant with Azure Policies

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

It's important to keep your virtual machine (VM) secure for the applications that you run. Securing your VMs can include one or more Azure services and features that cover secure access to your VMs and secure storage of your data. This article provides information that enables you to keep your VM and applications secure.

### VM-19 - Enable disk encryption and data at rest encryption by default

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

There are several types of encryption available for your managed disks, including Azure Disk Encryption (ADE), Server-Side Encryption (SSE) and encryption at host.

- Azure Disk Encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.
- Azure Disk Storage Server-Side Encryption (also referred to as encryption-at-rest or Azure Storage encryption) automatically encrypts data stored on Azure managed disks (OS and data disks) when persisting on the Storage Clusters.
- Encryption at host ensures that data stored on the VM host hosting your VM is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage clusters.
- Confidential disk encryption binds disk encryption keys to the virtual machine's TPM and makes the protected disk content accessible only to the VM.

### VM-20 - Enable VM Insights

**Category:  Monitoring**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

VM insights monitors the performance and health of your virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets. It monitors their running processes and dependencies on other resources. VM insights can help deliver predictable performance and availability of vital applications by identifying performance bottlenecks and network issues. It can also help you understand whether an issue is related to other dependencies.

### VM-21 - Configure diagnostic settings for all Azure resources

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Platform metrics are sent automatically to Azure Monitor Metrics by default and without configuration.
Platform logs provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on:

- Resource logs aren't collected until they're routed to a destination.
- Activity logs exist on their own but can be routed to other locations.

Each Azure resource requires its own diagnostic setting, which defines the following criteria:

- Sources: The type of metric and log data to send to the destinations defined in the setting. The available types vary by resource type.
- Destinations: One or more destinations to send to.

A single diagnostic setting can define no more than one of each of the destinations. If you want to send data to more than one of a particular destination type (for example, two different Log Analytics workspaces), create multiple settings. Each resource can have up to five diagnostic settings.

### CG-1 - A minimum of three replicas should be kept for production image versions

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Keep a minimum of 3 replicas for production images.  In multi-VM deployment scenarios the VM deployments can be spread to different replicas reducing the chance of instance creation processing being throttled due to overloading of a single replica. For every 20 VMs that you create concurrently, we recommend you keep one replica. For example, if you create 1000 VMs concurrently, you should keep 50 replicas (you can have a maximum of 50 replicas per region). To update the replica count, please go to the gallery -> Image Definition -> Image Version -> Update replication.

### CG-2 - Zone redundant storage should be used for image versions

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Use ZRS wherever available for high availability. You can configure ZRS in the replication tab when you create a version of the image or VM application. Azure Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) provides resilience against an Availability Zone failure in the region. With the general availability of Azure Compute Gallery, you can choose to store your images in ZRS accounts in [regions with Availability Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview#azure-regions-with-availability-zones).
You can also choose the account type for each of the target regions. The default storage account type is Standard_LRS, but it is recommended to select Standard_ZRS for regions with Availability Zones.

We recommend that you create a generation 2 virtual machine to take advantage of features like Secure Boot, vTPM, trusted launch VMs, large boot volume. Your choice to create a generation 1 or generation 2 virtual machine depends on which guest operating system you want to install and the boot method you want to use to deploy the virtual machine. You can't change a virtual machine's generation after you've created it. So it is recommended to review the [considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/plan/should-i-create-a-generation-1-or-2-virtual-machine-in-hyper-v#which-guest-operating-systems-are-supported) first.

### IT-1 - Use Generation 2 virtual machine source image

**Impact: Availability**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

When building your Image Templates, utilize source images that support generation 2 virtual machines. Generation 2 VMs support key features that aren't supported in generation 1 VMs.These features include increased memory, support for larger >2TB disks, it uses the new UEFI-based boot architecture rather than the BIOS-based architecture used by generation 1 VMs which can improve boot and installation times, Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), and virtualized persistent memory (vPMEM).

### IT-2 - Replicate your Image Templates to a secondary region

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

The Azure Image Builder service that is used to deploy Image Templates doesn't currently support availability zones. Therefore, when building your Image Templates, replicate them to a secondary region, preferably to your primary region's paired region. This will allow you to quickly recover from a region failure and continue to deploy virtual machines from your Image Templates.

### VNET-3 - When available, use Private Endpoints instead of Service Endpoints for PaaS Services

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Use virtual network service endpoints only when Private Link isn't available and there are no concerns with unauthorized movement of data. The VNet service endpoint feature (turning on VNet service endpoint on the network side and setting up appropriate VNet ACLs on the Azure service side) limits the Azure service access to the allowed VNet and subnet, thus providing a network level security and isolation of the Azure service traffic. All traffic using VNet service endpoints flows over Microsoft backbone, thus providing another layer of isolation from the public internet

### ST-1 - Ensure that Storage Account is redundant

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers other options for how your data is replicated in the primary or paired region:

- LRS synchronously replicates data 3 times in single physical location. It is least expensive replication but not recommended for apps with high availability and durability. LRS provides eleven 9 durability.
- ZRS copies data synchronously across 3 availability zone in primary region. ZRS is recommended for apps requiring high availability across zones. ZRS provides twelve 9s durability.
- GRS replicate additional 3 copies to secondary region and provides sixteen 9s availability.
- GZRS provides both high availability and redundancy across geo replication. It provides sixteen 9s durability over a given year.
