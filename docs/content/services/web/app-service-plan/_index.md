## Recommendations Details

### ASP-1 - Migrate App Service to availability Zone Support

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Deploying your App Service plans and App Service Environments across availability zones (AZ) is a feature provided by Azure to enhance the resiliency and reliability of your business-critical workloads. By distributing your applications across multiple availability zones, you can ensure their continued operation even in the event of a datacenter-level failure. This approach offers excellent redundancy without the need for deploying your applications in different Azure regions. Availability zones provide a higher level of fault tolerance, helping to safeguard your applications and minimize downtime. This enables your business to maintain continuity and deliver uninterrupted services to your customers.

### ASP-2 - Use Standard or Premium tier

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

The use of the Standard or Premium tier for Azure App Service Plan is crucial for highly resilient applications, as it provides advanced scaling, high availability, traffic management, enhanced performance, networking features, and multiple deployment slots, ensuring uninterrupted operation and robustness in the face of potential failures or increased demands.

### ASP-3 - Avoid scaling up or down

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

It is recommended to avoid scaling up or down your Azure App Service instances frequently. Instead, choose an appropriate tier and instance size that can handle your typical workload, and scale out the instances to accommodate changes in traffic volume. Scaling up or down can potentially trigger an application restart, which may result in service disruptions.

### ASP-4 - Create separate App Service plans for production and test

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

It is strongly recommended to create separate App Service plans for production and test environments. Avoid using slots within your production deployment for testing purposes. When apps within the same App Service plan share VM instances, combining production and test deployments can have adverse effects on the production environment. For instance, load tests conducted on the test deployment may degrade the live production site. By isolating test deployments in a separate plan, you ensure the separation and protection of the production version.

### ASP-5 - Enable Autoscale/Automatic scaling to ensure adequate resources are available to service requests

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

It is highly recommended to enable Autoscale/Automatic Scaling for your Azure App Service to ensure that sufficient resources are available to handle incoming requests. Autoscaling is rule based scaling while Automatic Scaling newer platform feature that performs automatic scale out and in based on HTTP traffic.
