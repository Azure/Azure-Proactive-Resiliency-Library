## Recommendations Details

### ASR-1 - Ensure static IP addresses configured in VM failover settings are available in the failover subnet

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Ensure static IP addresses configured in VM failover settings are available in the failover subnet. During failover if the target subnet has the same address space as source then the same static ip address is assigned to target VM provided it is available, otherwise the next available IP address in the target subnet is set as the target VM NIC address. You can modify the target IP address in the Network settings of the VM.

### ASR-2 - Perform a test failover to validate the functionality and performance of the VMs in the target location

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Perform a test failover to validate your BCDR strategy and ensure that your applications are functioning correctly in the target region. This can be done without impacting your production environment.
Test your Disaster Recovery plan periodically without any data loss or downtime, using test failovers.

**Resources**

- [Run a test failover](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-tutorial-dr-drill#run-a-test-failover)
