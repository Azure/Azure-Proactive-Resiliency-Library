## Recommendations Details

### IT-1 - Use Generation 2 virtual machine source image

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

When building your Image Templates, utilize source images that support generation 2 virtual machines. Generation 2 VMs support key features that aren't supported in generation 1 VMs.These features include increased memory, support for larger >2TB disks, it uses the new UEFI-based boot architecture rather than the BIOS-based architecture used by generation 1 VMs which can improve boot and installation times, Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), and virtualized persistent memory (vPMEM).

<br><br>

### IT-2 - Replicate your Image Templates to a secondary region

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

The Azure Image Builder service that is used to deploy Image Templates doesn't currently support availability zones. Therefore, when building your Image Templates, replicate them to a secondary region, preferably to your primary region's paired region. This will allow you to quickly recover from a region failure and continue to deploy virtual machines from your Image Templates.
