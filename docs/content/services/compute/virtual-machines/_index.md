## Recommendations Details

### VM-1 - Run production workloads on two or more VMs using VMSS Flex

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

To safeguard application workloads from downtime due to the temporary unavailability of a disk or VM, it's recommended that you run production workloads on two or more VMs using VMSS Flex. To achieve this you can use:

- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets to create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.
- Availability zones.

<br><br>

### VM-2 - Deploy VMs across Availability Zones

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Azure Availability Zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures. Use availability zones to protect your applications and data against unlikely datacenter failures.

<br><br>

### VM-3 - Migrate VMs using availability sets to VMSS Flex

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Availability sets will be retired in the near future. Modernize your workloads by migrating them from VMs to VMSS Flex. With VMSS Flex, you can deploy your VMs in one of two ways:

. Across zones
. In the same zone, but across fault domains (FDs) and update domains (UD) automatically.

In an N-tier application, it's recommended that you place each application tier into its own VMSS Flex.

<br><br>

### VM-4 - Replicate VMs using Azure Site Recovery

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

When you replicate Azure VMs using Site Recovery, all the VM disks are continuously replicated to the target region asynchronously. The recovery points are created every few minutes. This gives you a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in the order of minutes. You can conduct disaster recovery drills as many times as you want, without affecting the production application or the ongoing replication.

<br><br>

### VM-5 - Use Managed Disks for VM disks

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Managed disks provide better reliability for VMs in an availability set, because the disks are sufficiently isolated from each other to avoid single points of failure. Also, managed disks aren't subject to the IOPS limits of VHDs created in a storage account.

<br><br>

### VM-6 - Host application or database data on a data disk

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

A data disk is a managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data, or other data you need to keep. Data disks are registered as SCSI drives and are labeled with a letter that you choose. Hosting you data on a data disk also helps with flexibility when backuping or restoring data, as well as migrating the disk without having to migrate the entire Virtual Machine and Operating System. You will be able to also select a different disk sku, with different type, size, and performance that meet your requirements.

### VM-7 - Backup VMs with Azure Backup service

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Enable backups for your virtual machines to secure and quickly recover your data. The Azure Backup service provides simple, secure, and cost-effective solutions to back up your data and recover it from the Microsoft Azure cloud.

<br><br>

### VM-8 - Production VMs should be using SSD disks

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Premium SSD disks offer high-performance, low-latency disk support for I/O-intensive applications and production workloads. Standard SSD Disks are a cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels.

It is recommended that you:

- Use Standard HDD disks for Dev/Test scenarios and less critical workloads at lowest cost.
- Use Premium SSD disks instead of Standard HDD disks with your premium-capable VMs. For any Single Instance VM using premium storage for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, Azure guarantees VM connectivity of at least 99.9%.

If you want to upgrade from Standard HDD to Premium SSD disks, consider the following issues:

- Upgrading requires a VM reboot and this process takes 3-5 minutes to complete.
- If VMs are mission-critical production VMs, evaluate the improved availability against the cost of premium disks.

<br><br>

### VM-9 - Review VMs in stopped state

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Azure Virtual Machines (VM) instances go through different states. There are provisioning and power states. If a Virtual Machine is not running that indicates the Virtual Machine might facing an issue or is no longer necessary and could be removed helping to reduce costs.

**Resources**

- [States and billing status of Azure Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/states-billing?context=%2Ftroubleshoot%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Fcontext%2Fcontext#power-states-and-billing)

<br><br>

### VM-10 - Enable Accelerated Networking (AccelNet)

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the data path, which reduces latency, jitter, and CPU utilization for the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types.

This configuration is not always required, evaluate this option according to the workload requirements.

<br><br>

### VM-11 - When AccelNet is enabled, you must manually update the GuestOS NIC driver

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

When Accelerated Networking is enabled the default Azure Virtual Network interface in the GuestOS is replaced for a Mellanox and consecutively its driver is provided from a 3rd party vendor. Marketplace images maintained by Microsoft are offered with the latest version of Mellanox drivers, however, once the Virtual Machine is deployed, the customer is responsible for maintaining the driver up to date.

<br><br>

### VM-12 - VMs should not have a Public IP directly associated

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

If a Virtual Machine requires outbound internet connectivity we recommend the use of NAT Gateway or Azure Firewall, this will help to increase security and resiliency of the service as both services have much higher availability and SNAT ports. For inbound internet connectivity we recommend using a load balancing solution such as Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway.

<br><br>

### VM-13 - VM network interfaces and associated subnets both have a Network Security Group (NSG) associated

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Unless you have a specific reason to, we recommend that you associate a network security group to a subnet, or a network interface, but not both. Since rules in a network security group associated to a subnet can conflict with rules in a network security group associated to a network interface, you can have unexpected communication problems that require troubleshooting.

<br><br>

### VM-14 - IP Forwarding should only be enabled for Network Virtual Appliances

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

IP forwarding enables the virtual machine network interface to:

Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface.

Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations.

The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it. While IP forwarding is an Azure setting, the virtual machine must also run an application able to forward the traffic, such as firewall, WAN optimization, and load balancing applications.

### VM-16 - Shared disks should only be enabled in clustered servers

**Category: Storage**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Azure shared disks is a feature for Azure managed disks that enables you to attach a managed disk to multiple virtual machines (VMs) simultaneously. Attaching a managed disk to multiple VMs allows you to either deploy new or migrate existing clustered applications to Azure, and should only be used in those situations where the disk will be assigned to more than one Virtual Machine member of a Cluster.

**Guidance**

There are several types of encryption available for your managed disks, including Azure Disk Encryption (ADE), Server-Side Encryption (SSE) and encryption at host.

- Azure Disk Encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.
- Azure Disk Storage Server-Side Encryption (also referred to as encryption-at-rest or Azure Storage encryption) automatically encrypts data stored on Azure managed disks (OS and data disks) when persisting on the Storage Clusters.
- Encryption at host ensures that data stored on the VM host hosting your VM is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage clusters.
- Confidential disk encryption binds disk encryption keys to the virtual machine's TPM and makes the protected disk content accessible only to the VM.

### VM-20 - Enable VM Insights

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

VM insights monitors the performance and health of your virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets. It monitors their running processes and dependencies on other resources. VM insights can help deliver predictable performance and availability of vital applications by identifying performance bottlenecks and network issues. It can also help you understand whether an issue is related to other dependencies.

### VM-21 - Configure diagnostic settings for all Azure Virtual Machines

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Platform metrics are sent automatically to Azure Monitor Metrics by default and without configuration.
Platform logs provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on:

- Resource logs aren't collected until they're routed to a destination.
- Activity logs exist on their own but can be routed to other locations.

Each Azure resource requires its own diagnostic setting, which defines the following criteria:

- Sources: The type of metric and log data to send to the destinations defined in the setting. The available types vary by resource type.
- Destinations: One or more destinations to send to.

A single diagnostic setting can define no more than one of each of the destinations. If you want to send data to more than one of a particular destination type (for example, two different Log Analytics workspaces), create multiple settings. Each resource can have up to five diagnostic settings.
