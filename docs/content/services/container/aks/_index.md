## Recommendations Details

### AKS-1 - Deploy AKS cluster across availability zones

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Azure Availability Zones are a high-availability offering that protects applications and data from datacenter-level failures. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region that are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters and is designed to be highly available and fault tolerant.

By deploying resources such as aks clusters, virtual machines, storage, and databases across multiple Availability Zones in the same region, you can protect your applications and data from datacenter-level failures. If one Availability Zone goes down, the other Availability Zones in the region can continue to provide service.

**Resources**

<br><br>

### AKS-2 - Isolate system and application pods

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

AKS automatically assigns the label kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system to nodes in a system node pool. This label signals to AKS that system pods should be scheduled on nodes in this pool. However, you can still schedule application pods on these nodes if you choose to do so.

To prevent misconfigured or rogue application pods from accidentally killing system pods, it is recommended that you isolate critical system pods from your application pods. This can be achieved by scheduling system pods on dedicated node pools or by using node selectors to ensure that system pods are only scheduled on nodes with the kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system label.

<br><br>

### AKS-3 - Enable AKS-managed Azure AD integration

**Category: Access & Security**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Local Kubernetes accounts provide a legacy non-auditable means of accessing an AKS cluster and are not recommended for use. Enabling Azure AD integration on an AKS cluster provides several benefits for managing access to the cluster. By using Azure AD, you can centralize user and group management, enforce multi-factor authentication, and enable role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control to cluster resources. Additionally, Azure AD provides a secure and scalable authentication mechanism that can be integrated with other Azure services and third-party identity providers.

<br><br>

### AKS-4 - Configure Azure CNI networking for dynamic allocation of IPs

**Category: Networking**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

The Azure CNI networking solution provides several benefits for managing IP addresses and network connectivity for cluster pods including dynamic allocation of IPs to pods, allowing node and pod subnets to scale independently, direct network connectivity between pods and resources in the VNET and allowing different network policies for pods and nodes. It also supports different networking policies including Azure Network Policies and Calico.

<br><br>

### AKS-5 - Enable the cluster auto-scaler on an existing cluster

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

The cluster auto-scaler automatically scales the number of nodes in a node pool based on pod resource requests and the available capacity in the cluster. It helps ensure that the cluster can scale according to demand and prevent outages.

If the cluster has availability zones enabled, the following configuration changes need to be verified or established:

- Persistent Volumes - If the cluster is using persistent volumes backed by Azure Storage, ensure you have one nodepool per availability zone. Persistent volumes do not work across AZs and the auto-scaler could fail to create new pods if the nodepool cannot access the persistent volume.
- Multiple Nodepools per Zone - If the cluster has multiple nodepools per AZ, enable the `--balance-similar-node-groups` property through the auto-scaler profile. This feature detects similar nodepools and balances the number of nodes across them.

<br><br>

### AKS-6 - Back up Azure Kubernetes Service

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

AKS is increasingly being used for stateful applications that require a backup strategy. Azure Backup now allows you to back up AKS clusters (cluster resources and persistent volumes attached to the cluster) using a backup extension, which must be installed in the cluster. Backup vault communicates with the cluster via this Backup Extension to perform backup and restore operations."

<br><br>

### AKS-7 - Plan an AKS version upgrade

**Category: Compliance**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Minor version releases include new features and improvements. Patch releases are more frequent (sometimes weekly) and are intended for critical bug fixes within a minor version. Patch releases include fixes for security vulnerabilities or major bugs.
If you're running an unsupported Kubernetes version, you'll be asked to upgrade when requesting support for the cluster. Clusters running unsupported Kubernetes releases aren't covered by the AKS support policies.

**Resources**

<br><br>

### AKS-8 - Ensure that Persistent Volumes in storage account are redundant for Pods with stateful applications

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage for Persistent Volumes offers other options for how your data is replicated in the primary or paired region:

- LRS synchronously replicates data 3 times in single physical location. It is least expensive replication but not recommended for apps with high availability and durability. LRS provides eleven 9 durability.
- ZRS copies data synchronously across 3 availability zone in primary region. ZRS is recommended for apps requiring high availability across zones. ZRS provides twelve 9s durability.

In AKS Premium_ZRS and StandardSSD_ZRS disk types are supported. ZRS disk could be scheduled on the zone or non-zone node, without the restriction that disk volume should be co-located in the same zone as a given node.

### AKS-9 - Upgrade Persistent Volumes with deprecated version to Azure CSI drivers

**Category: Storage**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Starting with Kubernetes version 1.26, in-tree persistent volume types kubernetes.io/azure-disk and kubernetes.io/azure-file are deprecated and will no longer be supported. Removing these drivers following their deprecation is not planned, however you should migrate to the corresponding CSI drivers disks.csi.azure.com and file.csi.azure.com.

<br><br>

### AKS-10 - Implement Resource Quota to ensure that Kubernetes resources do not exceed hard resource limits

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

A resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by resources in that namespace.

<br><br>

### AKS-11 - Attach Virtual Nodes (ACI) to the AKS cluster

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

To rapidly scale application workloads in an AKS cluster, you can use virtual nodes. With virtual nodes, pods provision much faster than through the Kubernetes cluster auto-scaler.

If the cluster has availability zones enabled, the following configuration changes need to be verified or established:

- Persistent Volumes - If the cluster is using persistent volumes backed by Azure Storage, ensure you have one nodepool per availability zone. Persistent volumes do not work across AZs and the auto-scaler could fail to create new pods if the nodepool cannot access the persistent volume.

<br><br>

### AKS-12 - Update AKS tier to Standard

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Production AKS clusters should be configured with the Standard tier. The AKS free service doesn't offer a financially backed SLA and node scalability is limited. To obtain that SLA, Standard tier must be selected.

**Resources**

- [Pricing Tiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/free-standard-pricing-tiers)
- [AKS Baseline Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks?toc=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Faks%2Ftoc.json&bc=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Fbread%2Ftoc.json#kubernetes-api-server-sla)

### AKS-13 - Enable AKS Monitoring

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Azure Monitor collects events, captures container logs, collects CPU/Memory information from the Metrics API and allows the visualization of the data, to validate the near real time health and performance of AKS environments. The visualization tool can be Azure Monitor Container Insights, Prometheus, Grafana or others.

<br><br>

### AKS-14 - Use Ephemeral Disks on AKS clusters

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Ephemeral OS disks provide lower read/write latency on the OS disk of AKS agent nodes since the disk is locally attached, and it is not replicated as managed disks. You will also get faster cluster operations like scale or upgrade thanks to faster re-imaging and boot times.

### AKS-15 - Enable and remediate Azure Policies configured for AKS

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**
Azure Policies allow companies to enforce governance best practices in the AKS cluster around security, authentication, provisioning, networking and others.

### AKS-16 - Enable GitOps when using DevOps frameworks

**Category: Automation**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

GitOps is an operating model for cloud-native applications that stores application and declarative infrastructure code in Git to be used as the source of truth for automated continuous delivery. With GitOps, you describe the desired state of your entire system in a git repository, and a GitOps operator deploys it to your environment, which is often a Kubernetes cluster. To prevent potential outages or unsuccessful failover scenarios, GitOps helps maintain the configuration of all AKS clusters to the intended configuration.

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Configure Topology Spread Constraints to control how Pods are spread across your cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user-defined topology domains. This can help to achieve high availability as well as efficient resource utilization.

**Resources**

- [Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/)
- [Assign Pod Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/)

### AKS-18 - Configures Pods Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

AKS kubelet controller uses liveness probes to validate containers and applications health. Based on containers health, kubelet will know when to restart a container.

**Resources**

### AKS-19 - Configure pod replication in production applications to guarantee availability

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Configure ReplicaSets in the Pod or Deployment manifests to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. This feature will guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.
