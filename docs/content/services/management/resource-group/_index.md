## Recommendations Details

### RG-1 - Ensure Resource Group and its Resources are located in the same Region

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Ensure your resource locations match that of the containing resource group. This ensures that, in the event of a regional outage, you will still be able to manage your resource. ARM stores resource data for resources in a resource group and, if the region is unavailable, updates to this data could fail, making the resource effectively read-only.
