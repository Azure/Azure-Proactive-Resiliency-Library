## Recommendations Details

### AA-1 - Set up disaster recovery of Automation accounts and its dependent resources

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

 Set up disaster recovery of Automation accounts, and its dependent resources such as Modules, Connections, Credentials, Certificates, Variables and Schedules to handle a region-wide service outage or zone-wide failure. For disaster recovery, the replica Automation account must be already deployed and ready in the secondary region to failover if the Automation account in the primary region becomes unavailable. Ensure that your disaster recovery strategy considers your Automation account and the dependent resources.

 You can use the [PowerShell script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-disaster-recovery?tabs=win-hrw%2Cps-script%2Coption-one#script-to-migrate-automation-account-assets-from-one-region-to-another) to migrate assets of the Automation account from one region to another, or if you are using [ARM templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) to define and deploy Automation runbooks, you can use these templates to deploy the same runbooks in any other Azure region where you create the replica Automation account.
