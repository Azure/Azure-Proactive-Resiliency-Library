## Recommendations Details

### ST-1 - Ensure that Storage Account configuration is at least Zone redundant

**Category: Availability**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers other options for how your data is replicated in the primary or paired region:

- LRS synchronously replicates data 3 times in single physical location. It is least expensive replication but not recommended for apps with high availability and durability. LRS provides eleven 9 durability.
- ZRS copies data synchronously across 3 availability zone in primary region. ZRS is recommended for apps requiring high availability across zones. ZRS provides twelve 9s durability.
- GRS replicate additional 3 copies to secondary region and provides sixteen 9s availability.
- GZRS provides both high availability and redundancy across geo replication. It provides sixteen 9s durability over a given year.

### ST-2 - Do not use classic Storage Account

**Category: Governance**

**Impact: High**

**Guidance**

Azure classic Storage Account will retire 31 august 2024. So migrate all workload from classic storage to v2.

### ST-3 - Ensure Performance tier is set as per workload

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Consider using appropriate storage performance tier for standard storage / block blob / append blob / file-share and page blob. Each workload scenario requires appropriate Performance tier and its important that based on the type of transaction and blob type/file type appropriate performance tier is selected. Failing to do so will create performance bottleneck.

### ST-4 - Choose right storage account kind for workload

**Category: System Efficiency**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Block blobs are optimized for uploading large amounts of data efficiently. Block blobs are composed of blocks, each of which is identified by a block ID. A block blob can include up to 50,000 blocks

### ST-5 - Enable soft delete for recovery of data

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

Soft delete option allow for recovering data if its deleted by mistaken. Moreover Lock will prevent accidentally deleting storage account.

### ST-6 - Enable version for accidental modification and keep the number of versions below 1000

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Medium**

**Guidance**

To recover data from accidental modification or deletion enable versioning.
Having a large number of versions per blob can increase the latency for blob listing operations. Microsoft recommends maintaining fewer than 1000 versions per blob. You can use lifecycle management to automatically delete old versions.

<br><br>

### ST-7 - Enable point and time restore for containers for recovery

**Category: Disaster Recovery**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

You can use point-in-time restore to restore one or more sets of block blobs to a previous state
Point and time restore support general purpose v2 account in standard performance tier. Its a mechanism to protect data

### ST-8 - Configure Diagnostic Settings for all storage accounts

**Category: Monitoring**

**Impact: Low**

**Guidance**

Enabling diagnostic settings allow you to capture and view diagnostic information so that you can troubleshoot any failures.
