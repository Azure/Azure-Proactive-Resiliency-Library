This often involves specifying availability and recovery targets, latency tolerances, criticality classifications, and disaster recovery objectives.\nSummary of Recommendations Recommendation Category Impact State ARG Query Available WADF-1 - Ensure the Availability Targets are well defined and communicated across teams working on the Workload Availability High Verified No WADF-2 - Ensure the Recovery Targets are well defined and communicated across teams working on the Workload Disaster Recovery High Verified No Definitions of states can be found here Recommendations Details WADF-1 - Ensure the Availability Targets are well defined and communicated across teams working on the Workload Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nEnsure the Availability Targets (SLA, SLO, SLI) are well defined, tested, monitored and communicated across teams working on the Workload.\nA Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an availability target that represents a commitment around performance and availability of the application. Understanding the SLA of individual components within the system is essential to define reliability targets. Knowing the SLA of dependencies will also provide a justification for additional spend when making the dependencies highly available and with proper support contracts. Availability targets for any dependencies leveraged by the application should be understood and ideally align with application targets should also be considered.\nUnderstanding your availability expectations is vital to reviewing overall operations for the application.\nFor example, if you are striving to achieve an application Service Level Objective (SLO) of 99.999%, the level of inherent operational action required by the application is going to be far greater than if an SLO of 99.9% was the goal.\nResources\nUse business metrics to design resilient Azure applications Target functional and nonfunctional requirements WADF-2 - Ensure the Recovery Targets are well defined and communicated across teams working on the Workload Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nEnsure the Recovery Targets are well defined and communicated across teams working on the Workload. Two important metrics to consider are the recovery time objective and recovery point objective, as they pertain to disaster recovery.\nRecovery time objective (RTO) is the maximum acceptable time that an application can be unavailable after an incident. If your RTO is 90 minutes, you must be able to restore the application to a running state within 90 minutes from the start of a disaster. If you have a very low RTO, you might keep a second regional deployment continually running an active/passive configuration on standby, to protect against a regional outage. In some cases, you might deploy an active/active configuration to achieve even lower RTO. Recovery point objective (RPO) is the maximum duration of data loss that is acceptable during a disaster. For example, if you store data in a single database, with no replication to other databases, and perform hourly backups, you could lose up to an hour of data. RTO and RPO are non-functional requirements of a system and should be dictated by business requirements. To derive these values, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to conduct a risk assessment, and clearly understanding the cost of downtime or data loss. Monitoring and measuring application availability is vital to qualifying overall application health and progress towards defined targets. Make sure you measure and monitor key targets such as:\nMean Time Between Failures (MTBF) — The average time between failures of a particular component. Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) — The average time it takes to restore a component after a failure. Resources\nTarget functional and nonfunctional requirements "

Best practices for resilient and scalable systems are implemented, often including redundancy, failover strategies, and load balancing. In this phase failure mode and point analysis are coordinated in order to identify and mitigate possible failures, and single points of failures.\nSummary of Recommendations Recommendation Category Impact State ARG Query Available WADS-1 - Consider deploying your application across multiple zones Availability High Verified No WADS-2 - Consider deploying your application across multiple regions Disaster Recovery High Verified No WADS-3 - Ensure that all fault-points and fault-modes are understood and operationalized Availability High Verified No WADS-4 - Use PaaS Azure services instead of IaaS System Efficiency Medium Verified No WADS-5 - Design the application to scale out System Efficiency High Verified No WADS-6 - Create a landing zone for the workload following the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework Governance Low Verified No WADS-7 - Design a BCDR strategy that will help to meet the business requirements Disaster Recovery High Verified No WADS-8 - Provide security assurance through identity management Access \u0026amp; Security Medium Verified No WADS-9 - Ensure you address security-related risks helps to minimize application downtime and data loss caused by unexpected security exposures Access \u0026amp; Security High Verified No Definitions of states can be found here Recommendations Details WADS-1 - Consider deploying your application across multiple zones Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nDesign your application architecture to use availability zones within a region. Availability zones can be used to optimize application availability within a region by providing datacenter-level fault tolerance. However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively.\nConsider if component proximity is required for application performance reasons. If all or part of the application is highly sensitive to latency, components might need to be co-located which can limit the applicability of multi-region and multi-zone strategies.\nResources\nUse Availability Zones WADS-2 - Consider deploying your application across multiple regions Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nIf your application is deployed to a single region, and the region becomes unavailable, your application will also be unavailable. This might be unacceptable under the terms of your application\u0026rsquo;s SLA.\nIf so, consider deploying your application and its services across multiple regions. A multiregional deployment can use an active-active or active-passive configuration.\nAn active-active configuration distributes requests across multiple active regions. An active-passive configuration keeps warm instances in the secondary region, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t send traffic there unless the primary region fails.\nResources\nDesign reliable Azure applications Cross-region replication in Azure: Business continuity and disaster recovery WADS-3 - Ensure that all fault-points and fault-modes are understood and operationalized Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nEnsure that all fault-points and fault-modes are understood and operationalized.\nFailure mode analysis (FMA) is a process for building resiliency into a system, by identifying possible failure points in the system. The FMA should be part of the architecture and design phases, so that you can build failure recovery into the system from the beginning.\nIdentify all fault-points and fault-modes. Fault-points describe the elements within an application architecture which can fail, while fault-modes capture the various ways by which a fault-point may fail. To ensure an application is resilient to end-to-end failures, it is essential that all fault-points and fault-modes are understood and operationalized .\nResources\nFailure mode analysis for Azure applications WADS-4 - Use PaaS Azure services instead of IaaS Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Medium\nRecommendation/Guidance\nPaaS provides a framework for developing and running apps. As with IaaS, the PaaS provider hosts and maintains the platform\u0026rsquo;s servers, networks, storage, and other computing resources. But PaaS also includes tools, services, and systems that support the web application lifecycle. Developers use the platform to build apps without having to manage backups, security solutions, upgrades, and other administrative tasks.\nResources\nUse platform as a service (PaaS) options WADS-5 - Design the application to scale out Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nAzure provides elastic scalability and you should design to scale out. However, applications must leverage a scale-unit approach to navigate service and subscription limits to ensure that individual components and the application as a whole can scale horizontally. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about scale in, which is important to reduce cost. For example, scale in and out for App Service is done via rules. Often customers write scale out rules and never write scale in rules, which leaves the App Service more expensive.\nResources\nDesign to scale out WADS-6 - Create a landing zone for the workload following the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework Category: Governance\nImpact: Low\nRecommendation/Guidance\nFrom a workload perspective, a landing zone refers to a prepared platform into which the application gets deployed. A landing zone implementation can have compute, data sources, access controls, and networking components already provisioned. With the required plumbing ready in place; the workload needs to plug into it.\nWhen considering the overall security, a landing zone offers centralized security capabilities that adds a threat mitigation layer for the workload. Implementations can vary but here are some common strategies that enhance the security posture.\nIsolation through segmentation. You can isolate assets at several layers from Azure enrollment down to a subscription that has the resources for the workload. Consistent adoption of organizational policies, enforce creation and deletion of services and their configuration through Azure Policy. Configurations that align with principles of Zero Trust . For instance an implementation might have network connectivity to on-premises data centers. Resources\nAzure landing zone integration WADS-7 - Design a BCDR strategy that will help to meet the business requirements Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nDisaster recovery is the process of restoring application functionality after a catastrophic loss. In cloud environments, we acknowledge up front that failures happen. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component.\nTesting is one way to minimize these effects. You should automate testing of your applications where possible, but you also need to be prepared for when they fail. When a failure happens, having backup and recovery strategies becomes important. Your tolerance for reduced functionality during a disaster is a business decision that varies from one application to the next.\nIt might be acceptable for some applications to be temporarily unavailable, or partially available with reduced functionality or delayed processing. For other applications, any reduced functionality is unacceptable.\nKey points:\nCreate and test a disaster recovery plan regularly using key failure scenarios. Design a disaster recovery strategy to run most applications with reduced functionality. Design a backup strategy that\u0026rsquo;s tailored for the business requirements and circumstances of the application. Automate failover and failback steps and processes. Test and validate the failover and failback approach successfully at least once. Resources\nBackup and disaster recovery for Azure applications WADS-8 - Provide security assurance through identity management Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: Medium\nRecommendation/Guidance\nProvide security assurance through identity management: the process of authenticating and authorizing security principals. Use identity management services to authenticate and grant permission to users, partners, customers, applications, services, and other entities. Identity management is typically a centralized function not controlled by the workload team as a part of the workload\u0026rsquo;s architecture.\nDefine clear lines of responsibility and separation of duties for each function. Restrict access based on a need-to-know basis and least privilege security principles. Assign permissions to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope through Azure RBAC. Use built-in roles when possible. Prevent deletion or modification of a resource, resource group, or subscription through management locks. Use managed identities to access resources in Azure. Resources\nAzure identity and access management considerations WADS-9 - Ensure you address security-related risks helps to minimize application downtime and data loss caused by unexpected security exposures Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nSecurity is one of the most important aspects of any architecture. It provides the following assurances against deliberate attacks and abuse of your valuable data and systems: Confidentiality ,Integrity, and Availability. The security of complex systems depends on understanding the business context, social context, and technical context. As you design your system, cover these areas:\nEnsure that the identity provider (AAD/ADFS/AD/Other) is highly available and aligns with application availability and recovery targets. All external application endpoints are secured. Communication to Azure PaaS services secured using Virtual Network Service Endpoints or Private Link. Keys and secrets are backed-up to geo-redundant storage, and are still available in a failover case. Ensure that the process for key rotation is automated and tested. Emergency access break glass accounts have been tested and secured for recovering from Identity provider failure scenarios. Resources\nSecurity design principles "

Availability describes the amount of time that an application runs in a healthy state without significant downtime. Resiliency describes how quickly an application recovers from failure.\nBeing able to measure availability and resiliency can answer questions like: How much downtime is acceptable? How much does potential downtime cost your business? What are your availability requirements? How much do you invest in making your application highly available? What is the risk versus the cost? Testing plays a critical role in making sure your applications can meet these requirements.\nKey points:\nTest regularly to validate existing thresholds, targets, and assumptions. Automate testing as much as possible. Perform testing on both key Test environments and the production environment. Verify how the end-to-end workload performs under intermittent failure conditions. Test the application against critical functional and nonfunctional requirements for performance. Conduct load testing with expected peak volumes to Test scalability and performance under load. Perform chaos testing by injecting faults. Resources\nTesting applications for availability and resiliency WATS-2 - Consider building logic into your workload to handle errors Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: High\nRecommendation/Guidance\nIn a distributed system, ensuring that your application can recover from errors is critical. You can test your applications to prevent errors and failure, but you need to prepare for a wide range of issues. Testing doesn\u0026rsquo;t always catch everything, so you should understand how to handle errors and prevent potential failure.\nMany things in a distributed system, such as underlying cloud infrastructure and third-party runtime dependencies, are outside your span of control and your means to test. You can be sure something will fail eventually, so you need to be prepared.\nKey points:\nImplement retry logic to handle transient application failures and transient failures with internal or external dependencies. Uncover issues or failures in your application\u0026rsquo;s retry logic. Configure request timeouts to manage intercomponent calls. Configure and test health probes for your load balancers and traffic managers. Segregate read operations from update operations across application data stores.

Resources\nBackup and disaster recovery for Azure applications WATS-4 - Use chaos engineering to test Azure applications Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: Medium\nRecommendation/Guidance\nIdeally, you should apply chaos principles continuously. There\u0026rsquo;s constant change in the environments in which software and hardware run, so monitoring the changes is key. By constantly applying stress or faults on components, you can help expose issues early, before small problems are compounded by many other factors.\nApply chaos engineering principles when you:\nDeploy new code. Add dependencies. Observe changes in usage patterns. Mitigate problems. Resources\nUse chaos engineering to test Azure applications WATS-5 - Test application fault resiliency Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nHigh availability is a fundamental part of the SQL Database platform that works transparently for your database application. However, we recognize that you may want to test how the automatic failover operations initiated during planned or unplanned events would impact an application before you deploy it to production. You can manually trigger a failover by calling a special API to restart a database, or an elastic pool.\nIn the case of a zone-redundant serverless or provisioned General Purpose database or elastic pool, the API call would result in redirecting client connections to the new primary in an Availability Zone different from the Availability Zone of the old primary. So in addition to testing how failover impacts existing database sessions, you can also verify if it changes the end-to-end performance due to changes in network latency. Because the restart operation is intrusive and a large number of them could stress the platform, only one failover call is allowed every 15 minutes for each database or elastic pool.\nResources\nTest application fault resiliency "

	"content": " Contributions Notice Currently we can only accept contributions from Microsoft FTEs. In the future we will look to change this. Looking to contribute to the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library (APRL), well you have made it to the right place/page 👍\nFollow the below instructions, especially the pre-requisites, to get started contributing to the library.\nWriting a recommendation APRL recommendations are intended to enable and accelerate the delivery of Well Architected Reliability Assessments. The purpose of APRL is not to replace existing Azure public documentation and guidance on best practices.\nEach recommendation should be actionable for the customer. The customer should be able to place the recommendation in their backlog and the engineer that picks it up should have complete clarity on the change that needs to be made and the specific resources that the change should be made to.\nEach recommendation should include a descriptive title, a short guidance section that contains additional detail on the recommendation, links to public documentation that provide additional information related to the recommendation, and a query to identify resources that are not compliant with the recommendation. The title and guidance sections alone should provide sufficient information for a CSA to evaluate a resource.\nRecommendations should not require the CSA to spend a lot of time on background reading, they should not be open to interpretation, and they should not be vague. Remember that the CSA delivering the WARA is reviewing a large number of Azure resources in a limited amount of time and is not an expert in every Azure service.\nExamples\nGood recommendation: Use a /24 subnet for the service Bad recommendation: Size your subnet appropriately Not all best practices make good APRL recommendations. If the best practice relates to a particular service configuration and can be checked with an ARG query, it probably makes for a good APRL recommendation. If the best practice is more aligned to general architectural concepts that are true for many service or workload types, we very likely already have a recommendation in the APRL WAF section that addresses the topic. If not, consider adding a WAF recommendation to APRL. If neither is the case, APRL may not be the best location for this content.\nContext/Background Before jumping into the pre-requisites and specific section contribution guidance, please familiarize yourself with this context/background on how this library is built to help you contribute going forward.\nThis site is built using Hugo, a static site generator, that\u0026rsquo;s source code is stored in the APRL GitHub repo (link in header of this site too) and is hosted on GitHub Pages, via the repo.\nThe reason for the combination of Hugo \u0026amp; GitHub pages is to allow us to present an easy to navigate and consume library, rather than using a native GitHub repo, which is not easy to consume when there are lots of pages and folders. Also Hugo generates the site in such a way that it is also friendly for mobile consumers.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t have any skills in Hugo? That\u0026rsquo;s okay and you really don\u0026rsquo;t need them. Hugo just needs you to be able to author markdown (.md) files and it does the rest when it generates the site 👍\nPre-Requisites Read and follow the below sections to leave you in a \u0026ldquo;ready state\u0026rdquo; to contribute to APRL.\nA \u0026ldquo;ready state\u0026rdquo; means you have a forked copy of the Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library repo cloned to your local machine and open in VS Code.\nRun and Access a Local Copy of APRL During Development When in VS Code you should be able to open a terminal and run the below commands to access a copy of the APRL website from a local web server, provided by Hugo, using the following address http://localhost:1313/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library/:\nCopy cd docs hugo server -D Software/Applications To contribute to this project/repo/library you will need the following installed:\nYou can use winget to install all the pre-requisites easily for you. See the below section Git Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Extensions: editorconfig.editorconfig, streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker, ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare, medo64.render-crlf, vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons VS Code will recommend automatically to install these when you open this repo, or a fork of it, in VS Code. Hugo Extended winget Install Commands To install winget follow the install instructions here.\nCopy winget install --id \u0026#39;Git.Git\u0026#39; winget install --id \u0026#39;Microsoft.VisualStudioCode\u0026#39; winget install --id \u0026#39;Hugo.Hugo.Extended\u0026#39; Other requirements A GitHub profile/account A fork of the Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library repo into your GitHub org/account and cloned locally to your machine Instructions on forking a repo and then cloning it can be found here Useful Resources Below are links to a number of useful resources to have when contributing to APRL:\nAce Documentation Theme (that we use) - Docs Shortcodes - e.g. Code Ace Documentation Theme (that we use) - Repo The Example Site, which is the first link above, source code Hugo Quick Start Hugo Docs Markdown Cheat Sheet Steps to do before contributing anything (after pre-requisites) Run the following commands in your terminal of choice from the directory where you fork of the repo is located:\nCopy git checkout main git pull git fetch -p git fetch -p upstream git pull upstream main git push Doing this will ensure you have the latest changes from the upstream repo and you are ready to now create a new branch from main by running the below commands:\nCopy git checkout main git checkout -b \u0026lt;YOUR-DESIRED-BRANCH-NAME-HERE\u0026gt; Creating a Service\u0026rsquo;s Recommendation Page Important Make sure you have followed the the Steps to do before contributing anything (after pre-requisites) before following this section. The is a common task that is likely to be done is adding a new service to which you want to provide recommendations and supporting queries etc. for example Virtual Machines.\nFor this task we use Hugo\u0026rsquo;s archetype features which enables you to create a whole directory for a new service with a lot of templated content ready for you to change and use. This can be called by using the following command hugo new --kind service-bundle services/\u0026lt;category\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;service-name\nYou can see source code of the directory archetype called service-bundle here in the repo.\nFor the steps below we will use the Virtual Machine service as an example. Please change this to the service you are wanting to create. Steps to follow:\nIn your terminal of choice run the following: Copy cd docs/ hugo new --kind service-bundle services/compute/virtual-machines You will now see a new folder in content/services/compute called virtual-machines Copy ├───content │ ├───contributing │ └───services │ ├───ai-ml │ ├───compute │ │ └───virtual-machines │ │ └───code │ │ ├───cm-1 │ │ └───cm-2 Inside the virtual-machines folder you will see the following files pre-staged Copy │ │ └───virtual-machines │ │ │ _index.md │ │ │ │ │ └───code │ │ ├───cm-1 │ │ │ cm-1.azcli │ │ │ cm-1.kql │ │ │ cm-1.ps1 │ │ │ │ │ └───cm-2 │ │ cm-2.azcli │ │ cm-2.kql │ │ cm-2.ps1 Open _index.md in VS Code and make relevant changes You can copy the recommendations labelled CM-1 or CM-2 multiple times to create more recommendations Update Azure Resource Graph queries, PowerShell, AZCLI scripts in the code folder within virtual-machines You will see there is a folder, e.g. cm-1, cm-2, per recommendation to help with file structure organization Ensure you use the correct Azure resource abbreviations provided within our Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) documentation here. For example, use vm for Virtual Machines. Save, commit and push your changes to your branch and repo Create a create a Pull Request into the main branch of the upstream repo Get it merged Don\u0026rsquo;t forget you can see your changes live by running a local copy of the APRL website by following the guidance here. Automation Standards for Recommendations When creating recommendations for a service, please follow the below standards:\nRecommendation categories Each recommendation should have one and only one associated category from this list below.\nRecommendation Category Category Description Application Resilience Ensures software applications remain functional under failures or disruptions. Utilizes fault-tolerance, stateless architecture, and microservices to maintain application health and reduce downtime. Automation Uses automated systems or scripts for routine tasks, backups, and recovery. Minimizes human intervention, thereby reducing errors and speeding up recovery processes. Availability Focuses on ensuring services are accessible and operational. Combines basic mechanisms like backups with advanced techniques like clustering and data replication to achieve near-zero downtime. (Includes High Availability) Access \u0026amp; Security Encompasses identity management, authentication, and security measures for safeguarding systems. Centralizes access control and employs robust security mechanisms like encryption and firewalls. (Includes Identity) Governance Involves policies, procedures, and oversight for IT resource utilization. Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and compatibility requirements, while guiding overall system management. (Includes Compliance and Compatibility) Disaster Recovery Involves strategies and technologies to restore systems and data after catastrophic failures. Utilizes off-site backups, recovery sites, and detailed procedures for quick recovery after a disaster. System Efficiency Maintains acceptable service levels under varying conditions. Employs techniques like resource allocation, auto-scaling, and caching to handle changes in load and maintain smooth operation. (Includes Performance and Scalability) Monitoring Involves constant surveillance of system health, performance, and security. Utilizes real-time alerts and analytics to identify and resolve issues quickly, aiding in faster response times. Networking Aims to ensure uninterrupted network service through techniques like failover routing, load balancing, and redundancy. Focuses on maintaining the integrity and availability of network connections. Storage Focuses on the integrity and availability of data storage systems. Employs techniques like RAID, data replication, and backups to safeguard against data loss or corruption. Azure Resource Graph (ARG) Queries All ARG queries should have two comments at the top of the query, one comment stating Azure Resource Graph Query and another comment providing a description of the query results returned. For example:\n// Azure Resource Graph Query // Provides a list of Azure Container Registry resources that do not have soft delete enabled If the ARG query is under development, the query should have a single line stating: // under-development\nIf a recommendation query cannot be returned due to limitations with the data provided within ARG, the query should have a single line stating: // cannot-be-validated-with-arg\nQueries should only return resources that do not adhere to the APRL recommendation.

This is likely the most common task that will be performed.\nAll you need to do is just make edits directly to the existing markdown (.md) files, save your changes, commit, stage and push them to your branch and repo. Then create a Pull Request into the main branch of the upstream repo and you are done 👍\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget you can see your changes live by running a local copy of the APRL website by following the guidance here. Creating a Service Category Important Make sure you have followed the the Steps to do before contributing anything (after pre-requisites) before following this section. For this task we use Hugo\u0026rsquo;s archetype features which enables you to create a whole directory for a new service with a lot of templated content ready for you to change and use. This can be called by using the following command hugo new --kind category-bundle services/\u0026lt;category\u0026gt;\nYou can see source code of the directory archetype called category-bundle here in the repo.\nFor the steps below we will use the AAA category as an example. Please change this to the category you are wanting to create. Steps to follow:\nIn your terminal of choice run the following: Copy cd docs/ hugo new --kind category-bundle services/aaa You will now see a new folder in content/services called aaa Copy ├───content │ │ _index.md │ │ │ ├───contributing │ │ _index.md │ │ │ └───services │ │ _index.md │ │ │ ├───aaa │ │ _index.md Inside the aaa folder you will see the following file _index.md pre-staged Copy ├───aaa │ │ _index.md Open _index.md in VS Code and make relevant changes Save, commit and push your changes to your branch and repo Create a create a Pull Request into the main branch of the upstream repo Get it merged Don\u0026rsquo;t forget you can see your changes live by running a local copy of the APRL website by following the guidance here. Top Tips Sometimes the local version of the website may show some inconsistencies that don\u0026rsquo;t reflect the content you have created. If this happens, simply kill the Hugo local web server by pressing CTRL+C and then restart the Hugo web server by running hugo server -D from the docs/ directory "

If something fails, you need to know that it failed, when it failed, and why.\nMonitoring isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as failure detection. For example, your application might detect a transient error and retry, avoiding downtime. It should also log the retry operation so that you can monitor the error rate to get an overall picture of application health.\nKey points:\nDefine alerts that are actionable and effectively prioritized. Create alerts that poll for services nearing their limits and quotas. Use application instrumentation to detect and resolve performance anomalies. Track the progress of long-running processes. Troubleshoot issues to gain an overall view of application health. Document how to analyze, diagnose, and respond to signals being monitored Resources\nMonitoring application health for reliability WAMN-2 - Define a health model based on performance, availability, and recovery targets Category: Monitoring\nImpact: Low\nRecommendation/Guidance\nThe health model should be able to surface the health of critical system flows or key subsystems to ensure that appropriate operational prioritization is applied. For example, the health model should be able to represent the current state of the user sign-in transaction flow.\nThe health model shouldn\u0026rsquo;t treat all failures the same. The health model should distinguish between transient and non transient faults. It should clearly distinguish between expected-transient but recoverable failures and a true disaster state.\nKey points:\nKnow how to tell if an application is healthy or unhealthy.

Until you fail over, the secondary database remains read-only. Active geo-replication enables you to create readable replicas and manually failover to any replica if there is a datacenter outage or application upgrade. Up to four secondaries are supported in the same or different regions, and the secondaries can also be used for read-only access queries. The failover must be initiated manually by the application or the user.

With the introduction of Azure Availability Zones, SQL Database can place different replicas of the Business Critical database to different availability zones in the same region. To eliminate a single point of failure, the control ring is also duplicated across multiple zones as three gateway rings (GW). The routing to a specific gateway ring is controlled by Azure Traffic Manager (ATM).

Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region that are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters and is designed to be highly available and fault tolerant.\nBy deploying resources such as aks clusters, virtual machines, storage, and databases across multiple Availability Zones in the same region, you can protect your applications and data from datacenter-level failures. If one Availability Zone goes down, the other Availability Zones in the region can continue to provide service.\nResources\nAKS Availability Zones Zone Balancing Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Returns AKS clusters that do not have any availability zones enabled resources | where type == \u0026#39;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#39; | project id, name, location, properties.agentPoolProfiles | mv-expand properties_agentPoolProfiles | where isempty(array_length(properties_agentPoolProfiles.availabilityZones)) | project recommendationId=\u0026#34;aks-1\u0026#34;, id, name, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;nodePoolName: \u0026#34;, properties_agentPoolProfiles.name), param2=strcat(\u0026#34;orchestratorVersion: \u0026#34;, properties_agentPoolProfiles.orchestratorVersion), param3=strcat(\u0026#34;currentOrchestratorVersion: \u0026#34;, properties_agentPoolProfiles.currentOrchestratorVersion), param4=strcat(\u0026#34;numberOfZones: \u0026#34;, iff(isempty(array_length(properties_agentPoolProfiles.availabilityZones)), 0, array_length(properties_agentPoolProfiles.availabilityZones))) AKS-2 - Isolate system and application pods Category: Governance\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nAKS automatically assigns the label kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system to nodes in a system node pool. This label signals to AKS that system pods should be scheduled on nodes in this pool. However, you can still schedule application pods on these nodes if you choose to do so.\nTo prevent misconfigured or rogue application pods from accidentally killing system pods, it is recommended that you isolate critical system pods from your application pods. This can be achieved by scheduling system pods on dedicated node pools or by using node selectors to ensure that system pods are only scheduled on nodes with the kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system label.\nResources\nSystem and user node pools Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Returns each AKS cluster with nodepools that do not have taints set resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#34; | mv-expand agentPoolProfile = properties.agentPoolProfiles | extend taint = tostring(parse_json(agentPoolProfile.nodeTaints)) | extend nodePool = tostring(parse_json(agentPoolProfile.name)) | where isempty(taint) | project recommendationid=\u0026#34;aks-2\u0026#34;, id, name, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;nodepoolName: \u0026#34;, nodePool), param2=strcat(\u0026#34;taint: \u0026#34;, iff(isempty(taint), \u0026#34;None\u0026#34;, taint)) AKS-3 - Disable local accounts Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nLocal Kubernetes accounts provide a legacy non-auditable means of accessing an AKS cluster and are not recommended for use. Enabling Microsoft Entra integration on an AKS cluster provides several benefits for managing access to the cluster. By using Microsoft Entra, you can centralize user and group management, enforce multi-factor authentication, and enable role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control to cluster resources. Additionally, Microsoft Entra provides a secure and scalable authentication mechanism that can be integrated with other Azure services and third-party identity providers.\nResources\nEntra integration Use Azure role-based access control for AKS Manage AKS local accounts Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Returns a list of AKS clusters not using AAD enabled resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#34; | extend aadProfile = tostring (parse_json(properties.aadProfile)) | extend disablelocalAdmin = tostring(parse_json(properties.disableLocalAccounts)) | extend RBAC = tostring(parse_json(properties.enableRBAC)) | where RBAC == \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; | project recommendationId=\u0026#34;aks-3\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;aadProfile: \u0026#34;, aadProfile), param2=strcat(\u0026#34;disablelocalAdmin: \u0026#34;,disablelocalAdmin), param3=strcat(\u0026#34;RBAC: \u0026#34;, RBAC) AKS-4 - Configure Azure CNI networking for dynamic allocation of IPs Category: Networking\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nThe Azure CNI networking solution provides several benefits for managing IP addresses and network connectivity for cluster pods including dynamic allocation of IPs to pods, allowing node and pod subnets to scale independently, direct network connectivity between pods and resources in the VNET and allowing different network policies for pods and nodes. It also supports different networking policies including Azure Network Policies and Calico.\nResources\nConfigure Azure CNI networking Configure Azure CNI Overlay networking Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Check AKS Clusters using kubenet network profile resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#34; | extend networkProfile = tostring (parse_json(properties.networkProfile.networkPlugin)) | where networkProfile ==\u0026#34;kubenet\u0026#34; | project recommendationId=\u0026#34;aks-4\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;networkProfile :\u0026#34;,networkProfile) AKS-5 - Enable the cluster auto-scaler on an existing cluster Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nThe cluster auto-scaler automatically scales the number of nodes in a node pool based on pod resource requests and the available capacity in the cluster. It helps ensure that the cluster can scale according to demand and prevent outages.\nIf the cluster has availability zones enabled, the following configuration changes need to be verified or established:\nPersistent Volumes - If the cluster is using persistent volumes backed by Azure Storage, ensure you have one nodepool per availability zone. Persistent volumes do not work across AZs and the auto-scaler could fail to create new pods if the nodepool cannot access the persistent volume. Multiple Nodepools per Zone - If the cluster has multiple nodepools per AZ, enable the --balance-similar-node-groups property through the auto-scaler profile. This feature detects similar nodepools and balances the number of nodes across them.

Azure Backup now allows you to back up AKS clusters (cluster resources and persistent volumes attached to the cluster) using a backup extension, which must be installed in the cluster. Backup vault communicates with the cluster via this Backup Extension to perform backup and restore operations.\u0026quot;\nResources\nAKS Backups Best Practices for AKS Backups Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find AKS clusters that do not have backup enabled resources | where type =~ \u0026#39;Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters\u0026#39; | extend lname = tolower(name) | join kind=leftouter(recoveryservicesresources | where type =~ \u0026#39;microsoft.dataprotection/backupvaults/backupinstances\u0026#39; | extend lname = tolower(tostring(split(properties.dataSourceInfo.resourceID, \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;)[8])) | extend protectionState = properties.currentProtectionState | project lname, protectionState) on lname | where protectionState != \u0026#39;ProtectionConfigured\u0026#39; | extend param1 = iif(isnull(protectionState), \u0026#39;Protection Not Configured\u0026#39;, strcat(\u0026#39;Protection State: \u0026#39;, protectionState)) | project recommendationID = \u0026#34;aks-6\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1 AKS-7 - Plan an AKS version upgrade Category: Compliance\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nMinor version releases include new features and improvements. Patch releases are more frequent (sometimes weekly) and are intended for critical bug fixes within a minor version. Patch releases include fixes for security vulnerabilities or major bugs. If you\u0026rsquo;re running an unsupported Kubernetes version, you\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to upgrade when requesting support for the cluster. Clusters running unsupported Kubernetes releases aren\u0026rsquo;t covered by the AKS support policies.\nResources\nUpdating to the latest AKS version Upgrade cluster Auto-upgrading cluster Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-8 - Ensure that Persistent Volumes in storage account are redundant for Pods with stateful applications Category: Availability\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nData in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage for Persistent Volumes offers other options for how your data is replicated in the primary or paired region:\nLRS synchronously replicates data 3 times in single physical location. It is least expensive replication but not recommended for apps with high availability and durability. LRS provides eleven 9 durability. ZRS copies data synchronously across 3 availability zone in primary region. ZRS is recommended for apps requiring high availability across zones. ZRS provides twelve 9s durability. In AKS Premium_ZRS and StandardSSD_ZRS disk types are supported. ZRS disk could be scheduled on the zone or non-zone node, without the restriction that disk volume should be co-located in the same zone as a given node.\nResources\nAzure Disk CSI Driver Virtual Machine Disk Redundancy Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-9 - Upgrade Persistent Volumes with deprecated version to Azure CSI drivers Category: Storage\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nStarting with Kubernetes version 1.26, in-tree persistent volume types kubernetes.io/azure-disk and kubernetes.io/azure-file are deprecated and will no longer be supported. Removing these drivers following their deprecation is not planned, however you should migrate to the corresponding CSI drivers disks.csi.azure.com and file.csi.azure.com.\nResources\nCSI Storage Drivers CSI Migrate in Tree Volumes Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-10 - Implement Resource Quota to ensure that Kubernetes resources do not exceed hard resource limits Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nA resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by resources in that namespace.\nResources\nResource Quotas Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-11 - Attach Virtual Nodes (ACI) to the AKS cluster Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nTo rapidly scale application workloads in an AKS cluster, you can use virtual nodes. With virtual nodes, pods provision much faster than through the Kubernetes cluster auto-scaler.\nIf the cluster has availability zones enabled, the following configuration changes need to be verified or established:\nPersistent Volumes - If the cluster is using persistent volumes backed by Azure Storage, ensure you have one nodepool per availability zone. Persistent volumes do not work across AZs and the auto-scaler could fail to create new pods if the nodepool cannot access the persistent volume. Resources\nVirtual Nodes Azure Container Instances Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-12 - Update AKS tier to Standard Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nProduction AKS clusters should be configured with the Standard tier. The AKS free service doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer a financially backed SLA and node scalability is limited. To obtain that SLA, Standard tier must be selected.\nResources\nPricing Tiers AKS Baseline Architecture Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Returns all AKS clusters not running on the Standard tier resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#34; | where sku.tier != \u0026#34;Standard\u0026#34; | project recommendationId=\u0026#34;aks-12\u0026#34;, id, name, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;skuName: \u0026#34;, sku.name), param2=strcat(\u0026#34;skuTier: \u0026#34;, sku.tier) AKS-13 - Enable AKS Monitoring Category: Monitoring\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nAzure Monitor collects events, captures container logs, collects CPU/Memory information from the Metrics API and allows the visualization of the data, to validate the near real time health and performance of AKS environments. The visualization tool can be Azure Monitor Container Insights, Prometheus, Grafana or others.\nResources\nMonitor AKS Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Returns AKS clusters where either Azure Monitor is not enabled and/or Container Insights is not enabled resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#34; | extend azureMonitor = tostring(parse_json(properties.azureMonitorProfile.metrics.enabled)) | extend insights = tostring(parse_json(properties.addonProfiles.omsagent.enabled)) | where isempty(azureMonitor) or isempty(insights) | project recommendationId=\u0026#34;aks-13\u0026#34;,id, name, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;azureMonitorProfileEnabled: \u0026#34;, iff(isempty(azureMonitor), \u0026#34;false\u0026#34;, azureMonitor)), param2=strcat(\u0026#34;containerInsightsEnabled: \u0026#34;, iff(isempty(insights), \u0026#34;false\u0026#34;, insights)) AKS-14 - Use Ephemeral Disks on AKS clusters Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nEphemeral OS disks provide lower read/write latency on the OS disk of AKS agent nodes since the disk is locally attached, and it is not replicated as managed disks. You will also get faster cluster operations like scale or upgrade thanks to faster re-imaging and boot times.\nResources\nAKS Ephemeral OS Disk Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-15 - Enable and remediate Azure Policies configured for AKS Category: Governance\nImpact: Low\nGuidance Azure Policies allow companies to enforce governance best practices in the AKS cluster around security, authentication, provisioning, networking and others.\nResources\nAKS Baseline - Policy Management Built-in Policy Definitions for AKS Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg AKS-16 - Enable GitOps when using DevOps frameworks Category: Automation\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nGitOps is an operating model for cloud-native applications that stores application and declarative infrastructure code in Git to be used as the source of truth for automated continuous delivery. With GitOps, you describe the desired state of your entire system in a git repository, and a GitOps operator deploys it to your environment, which is often a Kubernetes cluster. To prevent potential outages or unsuccessful failover scenarios, GitOps helps maintain the configuration of all AKS clusters to the intended configuration.\nResources\nGitOps with AKS GitOps for AKS - Reference Architecture Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Returns AKS clusters where GitOps is not enabled resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters\u0026#34; | extend gitops = tostring (parse_json(properties.addOnProfiles.gitops.enabled)) | where isempty(gitops) | project recommendationId=\u0026#34;aks-16\u0026#34;, id, name, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;gitopsEnabled: \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;false\u0026#34;) AKS-17 - Configure affinity or anti-affinity rules based on application requirements Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nConfigure Topology Spread Constraints to control how Pods are spread across your cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user-defined topology domains.

Avoid using slots within your production deployment for testing purposes. When apps within the same App Service plan share VM instances, combining production and test deployments can have adverse effects on the production environment. For instance, load tests conducted on the test deployment may degrade the live production site. By isolating test deployments in a separate plan, you ensure the separation and protection of the production version.\nResources\nResiliency checklist for specific Azure services Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg ASP-5 - Enable Autoscale/Automatic scaling to ensure adequate resources are available to service requests Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nIt is highly recommended to enable Autoscale/Automatic Scaling for your Azure App Service to ensure that sufficient resources are available to handle incoming requests.

However, creating a new instance can take up to six or seven minutes. In order to avoid downtime for various failure modes, it is recommended that you configure a minimum instance count of two, ideally with Availability Zone support. By doing this, you will always have at least two instances in your Azure Application Gateway under normal circumstances. If one of them was to have a problem, there will always be another instance present to handle the traffic while a new instance is being created.

For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using premium storage for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 99.9%. Consider these factors when making your upgrade decision. The first is that upgrading requires a VM reboot and this process takes 3-5 minutes to complete. The second is if the VMs in the list are mission-critical production VMs, evaluate the improved availability against the cost of premium disks.\nPremium SSD disks offer high-performance, low-latency disk support for I/O-intensive applications and production workloads. Standard SSD Disks are a cost effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels.

The terminated cluster’s configuration is stored so that it can be reused (or, in the case of jobs, autostarted) at a later time. You can manually terminate a cluster or configure the cluster to terminate automatically after a specified period of inactivity. When the number of terminated clusters exceeds 150, the oldest clusters are deleted. You can also set auto termination for a cluster. During cluster creation, you can specify an inactivity period in minutes after which you want the cluster to terminate. However, The auto termination feature monitors only Spark jobs, not user-defined local processes. Therefore, if all Spark jobs have completed, a cluster may be terminated, even if local processes are running.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability?

Logs are delivered every five minutes and archived hourly in your chosen destination. When a cluster is terminated, Azure Databricks guarantees to deliver all logs generated up until the cluster was terminated.\nThe destination of the logs depends on the cluster ID. If the specified destination is dbfs:/cluster-log-delivery, cluster logs for 0630-191345-leap375 are delivered to dbfs:/cluster-log-delivery/0630-191345-leap375.\nResources\nCreate a cluster Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-9 - Use Delta Lake for higher reliability Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nDelta Lake is an open source storage format that brings reliability to data lakes. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing. Delta Lake runs on top of your existing data lake and is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs. Delta Lake on Databricks allows you to configure Delta Lake based on your workload patterns.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-10 - Use Photon Acceleration Category: Availability\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nApache Spark, as the compute engine of the Databricks Lakehouse, is based on resilient distributed data processing. In case of an internal Spark task not returning a result as expected, Apache Spark automatically reschedules the missing tasks and continues with the execution of the entire job. This is helpful for failures outside the code, like a short network issue or a revoked spot VM. Working with both the SQL API and the Spark DataFrame API comes with this resilience built into the engine.\nIn the Databricks Lakehouse, Photon, a native vectorized engine entirely written in C++, is high performance compute compatible with Apache Spark APIs.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-11 - Automatically rescue invalid or nonconforming data with Databricks Auto Loader or Delta Live Tables Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nInvalid or nonconforming data can lead to crashes of workloads that rely on an established data format. To increase the end-to-end resilience of the whole process, it is best practice to filter out invalid and nonconforming data at ingestion. Supporting rescued data ensures you never lose or miss out on data during ingest or ETL. The rescued data column contains any data that wasn’t parsed, either because it was missing from the given schema, because there was a type mismatch, or the column casing in the record or file didn’t match that in the schema.\nDatabricks Auto Loader: Auto Loader is the ideal tool for streaming the ingestion of files. It supports rescued data for JSON and CSV. Delta Live Tables: Another option to build workflows for resilience is using Delta Live Tables with quality constraints.

A common layering approach is:\nRaw layer (bronze): Source data gets ingested into the lakehouse into the first layer and should be persisted there. When all downstream data is created from the raw layer, rebuilding the subsequent layers from this layer is possible if needed.\nCurated layer (silver): The purpose of the second layer is to hold cleansed, refined, filtered and aggregated data. The goal of this layer is to provide a sound, reliable foundation for analyses and reports across all roles and functions.\nFinal layer (gold): The third layer is created around business or project needs. It provides a different view as data products to other business units or projects, preparing data around security needs (such as anonymized data) or optimizing for performance (such as with preaggregated views). The data products in this layer are seen as the truth for the business.\nThe final layer should only contain high-quality data and can be fully trusted from a business point of view.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-15 - Improve data integrity by reducing data redundancy Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nCopying or duplicating data creates data redundancy and will lead to lost integrity, lost data lineage, and often different access permissions. This will decrease the quality of the data in the lakehouse. A temporary or throwaway copy of data is not harmful on its own - it is sometimes necessary for boosting agility, experimentation and innovation. However, if these copies become operational and regularly used for business decisions, they become data silos. These data silos getting out of sync has a significant negative impact on data integrity and quality, raising questions such as “Which data set is the master?” or “Is the data set up to date?”.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-16 - Actively manage schemas Category: Governance\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nUncontrolled schema changes can lead to invalid data and failing jobs that use these data sets. Databricks has several methods to validate and enforce the schema:\nDelta Lake supports schema validation and schema enforcement by automatically handling schema variations to prevent the insertion of bad records during ingestion. Auto Loader detects the addition of new columns as it processes your data. By default, the addition of a new column causes your streams to stop with an UnknownFieldException. Auto Loader supports several modes for schema evolution. Resources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-17 - Use constraints and data expectations Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nDelta tables support standard SQL constraint management clauses that ensure that the quality and integrity of data added to a table are automatically verified. When a constraint is violated, Delta Lake throws an InvariantViolationException error to signal that the new data can’t be added. See Constraints on Azure Databricks.\nTo further improve this handling, Delta Live Tables supports Expectations: Expectations define data quality constraints on the contents of a data set. An expectation consists of a description, an invariant, and an action to take when a record fails the invariant. Expectations to queries use Python decorators or SQL constraint clauses. See Manage data quality with Delta Live Tables.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-18 - Create regular backups Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nTo recover from a failure, regular backups need to be available. The Databricks Labs project migrate allows workspace admins to create backups by exporting most of the assets of their workspaces (the tool uses the Databricks CLI/API in the background). See Databricks Migration Tool. Backups can be used either for restoring workspaces or for importing into a new workspace in case of a migration.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-19 - Recover from Structured Streaming query failures Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nStructured Streaming provides fault-tolerance and data consistency for streaming queries. Using Azure Databricks workflows, you can easily configure your Structured Streaming queries to restart on failure automatically. The restarted query continues where the failed one left off.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-20 - Recover ETL jobs based on Delta time travel Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nDespite thorough testing, a job in production can fail or produce some unexpected, even invalid, data. Sometimes this can be fixed with an additional job after understanding the source of the issue and fixing the pipeline that led to the issue in the first place. However, often this is not straightforward, and the respective job should be rolled back. Using Delta Time travel allows users to easily roll back changes to an older version or timestamp, repair the pipeline, and restart the fixed pipeline.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-21 - Use Databricks Workflows and built-in recovery Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nDatabricks Workflows are built for recovery. When a task in a multi-task job fails (and, as such, all dependent tasks), Azure Databricks Workflows provide a matrix view of the runs, which lets you examine the issue that led to the failure. See View runs for a job. Whether it was a short network issue or a real issue in the data, you can fix it and start a repair run in Azure Databricks Workflows. It runs only the failed and dependent tasks and keep the successful results from the earlier run, saving time and money.\nResources\nBest practices for reliability Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-22 - Configure a disaster recovery pattern Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nA clear disaster recovery pattern is critical for a cloud-native data analytics platform like Azure Databricks.

Doing this perfectly aligns with the ADB\u0026rsquo;s Workspace level isolation model. Most often organizations consider putting multiple workspaces in the same Vnet so that they all can share some common networking resource, like DNS, also placed in the same Vnet because the private address space in a vnet is shared by all resources. You can easily achieve the same while keeping the Workspaces separate by following the hub and spoke model and using Vnet Peering to extend the private IP space of the workspace Vnet.\nResources\nAzure Databricks Best Practices Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development DBW-27 - Do not Store any Production Data in Default DBFS Folders Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nThis recommendation is driven by security and data availability concerns.

Failures can range from software and hardware failures to events such as earthquakes, floods, and fires. Tolerance to failures is achieved because of redundancy and logical isolation of Azure services. To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions.\nResources\nUse availability zones for high availability in Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // This Resource Graph query will return all NetApp Volumes without AVzone defined. resources | where type =~ \u0026#34;microsoft.netapp/netappaccounts/capacitypools/volumes\u0026#34; | where zones == \u0026#34;[]\u0026#34; | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;ANF-3\u0026#34;, name, id, tags ANF-4 - Use snapshot and backup for in-region data protection in Azure NetApp Files Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nAzure NetApp Files snapshot technology delivers stability, scalability, and swift recoverability without impacting performance. Azure NetApp Files supports a fully managed backup solution for long-term recovery, archive, and compliance. Backups can be restored to new volumes in the same region as the backup.

If you are in a region that supports stretched clusters, consider enabling this feature to spread the VMware vSAN datastore across two availability zones. Note: Configuring an Azure VMware Solution private cloud as a stretched cluster can only be done during initial implementation and requires twice the amount of quota.

One way to reduce image size is to use the multi-stage Docker build approach to include only the necessary runtime components. Also check whether your image can include a lighter base OS image. And if you use a deployment environment such as Azure Container Instances that caches certain base images, check whether you can swap an image layer for one of the cached images.\nNumber of layers - Balance the number of layers used. If you have too few, you don’t benefit from layer reuse and caching on the host. Too many, and your deployment environment spends more time pulling and decompressing. Five to 10 layers is optimal.\nResources\nRegistry authentication options - Azure Container Registry Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg CR-5 - Use Repository namespaces Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nBy using repository namespaces, you can allow sharing a single registry across multiple groups within your organization. Registries can be shared across deployments and teams. Azure Container Registry supports nested namespaces, enabling group isolation. However, the registry manages all repositories independently, not as a hierarchy.\nResources\nRegistry best practices - use repository namespaces Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg CR-6 - Move Container Registry to a dedicated resource group Category: Governance\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nBecause container registries are resources that are used across multiple container hosts, a registry should reside in its own resource group.\nAlthough you might experiment with a specific host type, such as Azure Container Instances, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely want to delete the container instance when you\u0026rsquo;re done. However, you might also want to keep the collection of images you pushed to Azure Container Registry. By placing your registry in its own resource group, you minimize the risk of accidentally deleting the collection of images in the registry when you delete the container instance resource group.\nResources\nRegistry best practices - Use dedicated resource group Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // List container registries that contain additional resources within the same resource group. resources | where type =~ \u0026#34;microsoft.containerregistry/registries\u0026#34; | project registryName=name, registryId=id, registryTags=tags, resourceGroupId=strcat(\u0026#39;/subscriptions/\u0026#39;, subscriptionId, \u0026#39;/resourceGroups/\u0026#39;, resourceGroup), resourceGroup, subscriptionId | join kind=inner ( resources | where not(type =~ \u0026#34;microsoft.containerregistry/registries\u0026#34;) | summarize recourceCount=count() by subscriptionId, resourceGroup | where recourceCount != 0 ) on resourceGroup, subscriptionId | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;cr-6\u0026#34;, name=registryName, id=registryId, tags=registryTags, param1=strcat(\u0026#39;resourceGroupName:\u0026#39;,resourceGroup), param2=strcat(\u0026#39;resourceGroupId:\u0026#39;,resourceGroupId) CR-7 - Manage registry size Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nThe storage constraints of each container registry service tier are intended to align with a typical scenario: Basic for getting started, Standard for most production applications, and Premium for hyper-scale performance and geo-replication. Throughout the life of your registry, you should manage its size by periodically deleting unused content. Consider also enabling a retention policy to automatically delete untagged image manifests to free up storage space.\nResources\nRegistry best practices - Manage registry size Retention Policy Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find all Container Registries that have their retention policy disabled resources | where type =~ \u0026#34;microsoft.containerregistry/registries\u0026#34; | where properties.policies.retentionPolicy.status == \u0026#34;disabled\u0026#34; | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;cr-7\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1=\u0026#39;retentionPolicy:disabled\u0026#39; | order by id asc CR-8 - Disable anonymous pull access Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nBy default, access to pull or push content from an Azure container registry is only available to authenticated users. Enabling anonymous (unauthenticated) pull access makes all registry content publicly available for read (pull) actions. Warning: Anonymous pull access currently applies to all repositories in the registry. If you manage repository access using repository-scoped tokens, all users may pull from those repositories in a registry enabled for anonymous pull. We recommend deleting tokens when anonymous pull access is enabled.\nResources\nEnable anonymous pull access Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find all Container Registries that have anonymous pull access enabled resources | where type =~ \u0026#34;microsoft.containerregistry/registries\u0026#34; | where properties.anonymousPullEnabled == \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;cr-8\u0026#34;, name, id, tags | order by id asc CR-10 - Configure Diagnostic Settings for all Azure Container Registries Category: Monitoring\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nResource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.\nResources\nMonitoring Azure Container Registry data reference - Resource Logs Monitor Azure Container Registry - Enable diagnostic logs Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg CR-11 - Monitor Azure Container Registry with Azure Monitor Category: Monitoring\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nWhen you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. Azure Container Registry creates monitoring data using Azure Monitor, which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure that provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources in addition to resources in other clouds and on-premises.\nResources\nMonitoring Azure Container Registry data reference Monitor Azure Container Registry Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // cannot-be-validated-with-arg CR-12 - Enable soft delete policy Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nOnce you enable the soft delete policy, ACR manages the deleted artifacts as the soft deleted artifacts with a set retention period.

Cosmos DB is by default highly resilient by running four replicas, but it is still susceptible to failures or issues with entire regions or availability zones. As such, it is crucial to enable at least a secondary region on your Cosmos DB to achieve higher SLA. Doing so does not incur any downtime at all and it is as easy as selecting a pin on map.\nResources\nDistribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy Resources | where type =~ \u0026#39;Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts\u0026#39; | where array_length(properties.locations) \u0026lt; 2 | project recommendationId=\u0026#39;cosmos-1\u0026#39;, name, id, tags COSMOS-2 - Enable service-managed failover for multi-region accounts with single write region Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nCosmos DB is a battle-tested service with extremely high uptime and resiliency, but even the most resilient of systems sometimes run into a small hiccup. Should a region become unavailable, the Service-Managed failover option allows Azure Cosmos DB to fail over automatically to the next available region with no user action needed.\nResources\nManage an Azure Cosmos DB account by using the Azure portal | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development COSMOS-3 - Evaluate multi-region write capability Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nMulti-region write capability enables you to design multi-region application that is inherently highly available by virtue of being active in multiple regions. This, however, requires that you pay close considerations to consistency requirements and handle potential writes conflicts by way of conflict resolution policy. On the flip side, blindly enabling this configuration can lead to decreased availability due to unexpected application behavior and data corruption due to unhandled conflicts.\nResources\nDistribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB | Microsoft Learn Conflict resolution types and resolution policies in Azure Cosmos DB | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy Resources | where type =~ \u0026#39;Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts\u0026#39; | where array_length(properties.locations) \u0026gt; 1 and properties.enableMultipleWriteLocations == false | project recommendationId=\u0026#39;cosmos-3\u0026#39;, name, id, tags COSMOS-4 - Choose appropriate consistency mode reflecting data durability requirements Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nWithin a globally distributed database environment, there is a direct relationship between the consistency level and data durability in the presence of a region-wide outage. As you develop your business continuity plan, you need to understand the maximum period of recent data updates the application can tolerate losing when recovering after a disruptive event. We recommend using Session consistency unless you have established that stronger consistency mode is needed, you are willing to tolerate higher write latencies, and understand that outages on read-only regions can affect the ability of write region to accept writes.\nResources\nConsistency level choices - Azure Cosmos DB | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development COSMOS-5 - Configure continuous backup mode Category: Disaster Recovery\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nCosmos DB automatically backs up your data and there is no way to turn back ups off. In short, you are always protected. But should any mishap occur – a process that went haywire and deleted data it shouldn’t, customer data was overwritten by accident, etc. – minimizing the time it takes to revert the changes is of the essence. With continuous mode, you can self-serve restore your database/collection to a point in time before such mishap occurred. With periodic mode, however, you must contact Microsoft support, which despite us striving to provide speedy help will inevitably increase the restore time.\nResources\nContinuous backup with point in time restore feature in Azure Cosmos DB | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy Resources | where type =~ \u0026#39;Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts\u0026#39; | where properties.backupPolicy.type == \u0026#39;Periodic\u0026#39; and properties.enableMultipleWriteLocations == false and properties.enableAnalyticalStorage == false | project recommendationId=\u0026#39;cosmos-5\u0026#39;, name, id, tags COSMOS-6 - Ensure query results are fully drained Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nCosmos DB limits single response to 4 MB. If your query requests a large amount of data or data from multiple backend partitions, the results will span multiple pages for which separate requests must be issued. Each result page will indicate whether more results are available and provide a continuation token to access the next page.

As such it is critical to maintain only one instance, a so-called “singleton”, of the SDK client per account per application. Connections, both HTTP and TCP, are scoped to the client instance. Most compute environments have limitations in terms of the number of connections that can be open at the same time and when these limits are reached, connectivity will be affected.\nResources\nDesigning resilient applications with Azure Cosmos DB SDKs | Microsoft Learn Resource Graph Query/Scripts Show/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development COSMOS-8 - Implement retry logic in your client Category: Application Resilience\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nCosmos DB SDKs by default handle large number of transient errors and automatically retry operations, where possible.

From a resiliency perspective this is not recommended. If one of the ExpressRoute Direct ports goes down, and your ExpressRoute circuits are already consuming 100% of the 10-Gbps or 100-Gbps, the second ExpressRoute Direct port wouldn’t have bandwidth enough to support any additional load. One reason a port may be down would be during a maintenance event. The remaining port would support all traffic during the maintenance event, up to the 10-Gbps or 100-Gbps capacity. Unless you use rate limiting for ExpressRoute Direct circuits (Preview) to limit the bandwidth of non-production connections, you should not over-subscribe your ExpressRoute Direct ports being used for production workloads.\nResources\nAbout ExpressRoute Direct: Circuit Sizes Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development ERD-3 - Enable rate-limiting to help optimize network performance by controlling the traffic volume across all your ExpressRoute Direct based Circuits - In Preview Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Medium\nRecommendation/Guidance\nRate limiting is a feature that enables you to control the traffic volume between your on-premises network and Azure over an ExpressRoute Direct circuit.

Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load balancer. It sends traffic directly to your origin\u0026rsquo;s endpoints. In contrast, Front Door terminates connections at points of presence (PoPs) near to the client and establishes separate long-lived connections to the origins. The products work differently and are intended for different use cases.\nIf you need content caching and delivery (CDN), TLS termination, advanced routing capabilities, or a web application firewall (WAF), consider using Front Door. For simple global load balancing with direct connections from your client to your endpoints, consider using Traffic Manager.\nHowever, as part of a complex architecture, you might choose to use Traffic Manager in front of Front Door. In the unlikely event that Front Door is unavailable, Traffic Manager can route traffic to an alternative destination, such as Azure Application Gateway or a partner content delivery network (CDN). These architectures are difficult to implement and most customers don\u0026rsquo;t need them.\nResources\nAzure Load Balancing Options Azure Traffic Manager Azure Front Door Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development AFD-2 - Restrict traffic to your origins Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nFront Door\u0026rsquo;s features work best when traffic only flows through Front Door.

It then establishes new connections from each point of presence (PoP) to the origin. It\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to secure each of these connections with TLS, even for origins that are hosted in Azure.

By using \u0026lsquo;Latest\u0026rsquo;, you avoid having to reconfigure Front Door to use new versions of your certificate and waiting for the certificate to be deployed throughout Front Door\u0026rsquo;s environments.\nResources\nSelect the certificate for Azure Front Door to deploy Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development AFD-9 - Use the same domain name on Front Door and your origin Category: Networking\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nFront Door can rewrite the Host header of incoming requests. This feature can be helpful when you manage a set of customer-facing custom domain names that route to a single origin. This feature can also help when you want to avoid configuring custom domain names in Front Door and at your origin. However, when you rewrite the Host header, request cookies and URL redirections might break. In particular, when you use platforms like Azure App Service, features like session affinity and authentication and authorization might not work correctly.\nBefore you rewrite the Host header of your requests, carefully consider whether your application is going to work correctly.\nResources\nPreserve the original HTTP host name between a reverse proxy and its back-end web application Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development AFD-10 - Enable the WAF Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nFor internet-facing applications, we recommend you enable the Front Door web application firewall (WAF) and configure it to use managed rules.

When a health probe detects a problem with an origin, Front Door can be configured to send traffic to another origin in the origin group.\nIf you only have a single origin, Front Door always routes traffic to that origin even if its health probe reports an unhealthy status. The status of the health probe doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything to change Front Door\u0026rsquo;s behavior. In this scenario, health probes don\u0026rsquo;t provide a benefit and you should disable them to reduce the traffic on your origin.\nResources\nHealth probes Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development AFD-12 - Select good health probe endpoints Category: Availability\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nConsider the location where you tell Front Door\u0026rsquo;s health probe to monitor. It\u0026rsquo;s usually a good idea to monitor a webpage or location that you specifically design for health monitoring. Your application logic can consider the status of all of the critical components required to serve production traffic including application servers, databases, and caches.

In some scenarios, you may want to restrict the access to your web application by countries/regions. The Web application firewall (WAF) service in Front Door enables you to define a policy using custom access rules for a specific path on your endpoint to either allow or block access from specified countries/regions.\nA WAF policy contains a set of custom rules. The rule consists of match conditions, an action, and a priority. In a match condition, you define a match variable, operator, and match value. For a geo filtering rule, a match variable is either RemoteAddr or SocketAddr. RemoteAddr is the original client IP that is usually sent via X-Forwarded-For request header. SocketAddr is the source IP address WAF sees. If your user is behind a proxy, SocketAddr is often the proxy server address. The operator in the case of this geo filtering rule is GeoMatch, and the value is a two letter country/region code of interest. \u0026ldquo;ZZ\u0026rdquo; country code or \u0026ldquo;Unknown\u0026rdquo; country captures IP addresses that are not yet mapped to a country in our dataset. You may add ZZ to your match condition to avoid false positives. You can combine a GeoMatch condition and a REQUEST_URI string match condition to create a path-based geo-filtering rule.\nResources\nGeo filter WAF policy - GeoMatch Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // under-development AFD-15 - Secure your Origin with Private Link in Azure Front Door Category: Access \u0026amp; Security\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nAzure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS services and services hosted in Azure over a private endpoint in your virtual network.

You can choose to scale your resource manually to a specific instance count, or via a custom Autoscale policy that scales based on metric(s) thresholds, or schedule instance count which scales during designated time windows. Autoscale enables your resource to be performant and cost effective by adding and removing instances based on demand.\nResources\nGet started with autoscale in Azure Overview of autoscale in Azure Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find VMSS instances associated with autoscale settings when autoscale is disabled resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | project name, id, tags | join kind=leftouter ( resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.insights/autoscalesettings\u0026#34; | where tostring(properties.targetResourceUri) contains \u0026#34;Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets\u0026#34; | project id = tostring(properties.targetResourceUri), autoscalesettings = properties ) on id | where isnull(autoscalesettings) or autoscalesettings.enabled == \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-4\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1 = \u0026#34;autoscalesettings: Disabled\u0026#34; | order by id asc VMSS-5 - Enable Predictive autoscale and configure at least for Forecast Only Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nPredictive autoscale uses machine learning to help manage and scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets with cyclical workload patterns. It forecasts the overall CPU load to your virtual machine scale set, based on your historical CPU usage patterns. It predicts the overall CPU load by observing and learning from historical usage. This process ensures that scale-out occurs in time to meet the demand.\nResources\nUse predictive autoscale to scale out before load demands in virtual machine scale sets Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find VMSS instances associated with autoscale settings when predictiveAutoscalePolicy_scaleMode is disabled resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | project name, id, tags | join kind=leftouter ( resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.insights/autoscalesettings\u0026#34; | where tostring(properties.targetResourceUri) contains \u0026#34;Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets\u0026#34; | project id = tostring(properties.targetResourceUri), autoscalesettings = properties ) on id | where autoscalesettings.enabled == \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; and autoscalesettings.predictiveAutoscalePolicy.scaleMode == \u0026#34;Disabled\u0026#34; | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-5\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1 = \u0026#34;predictiveAutoscalePolicy_scaleMode: Disabled\u0026#34; | order by id asc VMSS-6 - Disable Force strictly even balance across zones to avoid scale in and out fail attempts Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nMicrosoft recommends disabling the setting that enforces strictly even distribution of VM instances across Availability Zones within a region in your VMSS configuration. In other words, you should allow Azure to distribute VM instances unevenly across Availability Zones.\nForce strictly even balance across zones: Azure provides the option to distribute VM instances in a VMSS evenly across Availability Zones within a region. An Availability Zone is a physically separate data center within an Azure region with independent power, cooling, and networking. This configuration enhances the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.\nScale in and out fail attempts: In the context of VMSS, \u0026ldquo;scaling in\u0026rdquo; refers to reducing the number of VM instances when demand decreases, while \u0026ldquo;scaling out\u0026rdquo; refers to increasing the number of instances when demand increases. Scaling is an important feature of VMSS, and it can be automatic based on various scaling rules and metrics.\nWhile Azure VMSS provides the option to enforce even distribution of VM instances across Availability Zones for increased resilience, there may be scenarios where disabling this option makes sense to better align with your application\u0026rsquo;s load distribution and scaling requirements.\nResources\nUse scale-in policies with Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find VMSS instances where strictly zoneBalance is set to True resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | where properties.orchestrationMode == \u0026#34;Uniform\u0026#34; and properties.zoneBalance == true | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-6\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1 = \u0026#34;strictly zoneBalance: Enabled\u0026#34; | order by id asc VMSS-7 - Configure Allocation Policy Spreading algorithm to Max Spreading Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: Medium\nGuidance\nWith max spreading, the scale set spreads your VMs across as many fault domains as possible within each zone. This spreading could be across greater or fewer than five fault domains per zone. With static fixed spreading, the scale set spreads your VMs across exactly five fault domains per zone. If the scale set cannot find five distinct fault domains per zone to satisfy the allocation request, the request fails.\nResources\nAvailability Considerations Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find VMSS instances where Spreading algorithm is set to Static resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | where properties.platformFaultDomainCount \u0026gt; 1 | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-7\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1 = \u0026#34;platformFaultDomainCount: Static\u0026#34; | order by id asc VMSS-8 - Deploy VMSS across availability zones with VMSS Flex Category: Availability\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nWhen you create your VMSS, use availability zones to protect your applications and data against unlikely datacenter failure.\nResources\nCreate a Virtual Machine Scale Set that uses Availability Zones Update scale set to add availability zones Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find VMSS instances with one or no Zones selected resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | where array_length(zones) \u0026lt;= 1 or isnull(zones) | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-8\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1 = \u0026#34;AvailabilityZones: Single Zone\u0026#34; | order by id asc VMSS-9 - Set Patch orchestration options to Azure-orchestrated Category: Automation\nImpact: Low\nGuidance\nEnabling automatic VM guest patching for your Azure VMs helps ease update management by safely and automatically patching virtual machines to maintain security compliance, while limiting the blast radius of VMs. Note that the KQL below will not return Virtual Machine Scale Sets using Uniform orchestration.\nResources\nAutomatic VM Guest Patching for Azure VMs Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | join kind=inner ( resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachines\u0026#34; | project id = tostring(properties.virtualMachineScaleSet.id), vmproperties = properties ) on id | extend recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-9\u0026#34;, param1 = \u0026#34;patchMode: Manual\u0026#34;, vmproperties.osProfile.linuxConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode | where isnotnull(vmproperties.osProfile.linuxConfiguration) and vmproperties.osProfile.linuxConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode !in (\u0026#34;AutomaticByPlatform\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AutomaticByOS\u0026#34;) | distinct recommendationId, name, id, param1 | union (resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets\u0026#34; | join kind=inner ( resources | where type == \u0026#34;microsoft.compute/virtualmachines\u0026#34; | project id = tostring(properties.virtualMachineScaleSet.id), vmproperties = properties ) on id | extend recommendationId = \u0026#34;vmss-9\u0026#34;, param1 = \u0026#34;patchMode: Manual\u0026#34;, vmproperties.osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode | where isnotnull(vmproperties.osProfile.windowsConfiguration) and vmproperties.osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode !in (\u0026#34;AutomaticByPlatform\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AutomaticByOS\u0026#34;) | distinct recommendationId, name, id, param1) VMSS-10 - Upgrade VMSS Image versions scheduled to be deprecated or already retired Category: Governance\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nEnsure current versions of images are in use to avoid disruption after image deprecation.

Some example use cases include development and test servers, low traffic web servers, small to medium databases, proof-of-concepts, and code repositories.\nB-series VMs are ideal for workloads that do not need the full performance of the CPU continuously, like web servers, proof of concepts, small databases and development build environments. These workloads typically have burstable performance requirements. To determine the physical hardware on which this size is deployed, query the virtual hardware from within the virtual machine. The B-series provides you with the ability to purchase a VM size with baseline performance that can build up credits when it is using less than its baseline. When the VM has accumulated credits, the VM can burst above the baseline using up to 100% of the vCPU when your application requires higher CPU performance. Upon consuming all the CPU credits, a B-series virtual machine is throttled back to its base CPU performance until it accumulates the credits to CPU burst again.\nResources\nB-series burstable virtual machine sizes Resource Graph Query/Scripts\nShow/Hide Query/Script Copy // Azure Resource Graph Query // Find all VMs using A or B series families resources | where type == \u0026#39;microsoft.compute/virtualmachines\u0026#39; | where properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize contains \u0026#34;Standard_B\u0026#34; or properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize contains \u0026#34;Standard_A\u0026#34; | project recommendationId = \u0026#34;vm-23\u0026#34;, name, id, tags, param1=strcat(\u0026#34;vmSku: \u0026#34; , properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize) VM-24 - Mission Critical Workloads should be using Premium or Ultra Disks Category: System Efficiency\nImpact: High\nGuidance\nAzure Premium SSDs deliver high-performance and low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) with input/output (IO)-intensive workloads.\nPremium SSD v2 offers higher performance than Premium SSDs while also generally being less costly. You can individually tweak the performance (capacity, throughput, and IOPS) of Premium SSD v2 disks at any time, allowing workloads to be cost efficient while meeting shifting performance needs. You should use Premium solid-state drives (SSDs) as operating system (OS) disks as the V2 is not supported as OS Disk.\nAzure ultra disks are the highest-performing storage option for Azure virtual machines (VMs). You can change the performance parameters of an ultra disk without having to restart your VMs. Ultra disks are suited for data-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top-tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads. Ultra disks must be used as data disks and can only be created as empty disks.
